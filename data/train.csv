The staffs were receptive and helpful. The service is undoubtedly good.

For food, we had ordered ""Tripple Schezwan"" which was basically rice and noodles cooked together. It was good in taste.

For drinks, we went for their signature drink ""Bubble Mojito"" and ""Brownie Shake"". Both were good but I liked their brownie shake more since it literally had brownie crumps all throughout the drink, unlike other cafes.

Price are not on the higher side.

Will visit again for more!",positive

The size of litti is very regular too...nothing extraordinary. Normally a litti costs around Rs.6 to Rs.8 in and around our area of Sealdah. Moreover they are simply adding on ghee later, unlike other stores which dip the littis into ghee itself. Not at all satisfied with the overall experience.",neutral

Food was okiesh....
We ordered a chilli chicken, chicken 65 and chili garlic noodles.
The chinese appetiser was drooling but chicken 65 was average, it was hard and had a lot of curry leaves as garnish.
The service was good. They charged extra service tax of 10% after including gst.
Sheesha was good, but we were not allowed to choose the flavours for the complimentary hookah which they served due to some offers running in their cafe.
Staff was good.
Over all a rating of 4stars.",positive

I am very happy about my decision of celebrating friendship day here with my best friend!
The decor is very classy and has a green element in it.
I ordered :
Chicken lamba- The chicken was minced and tossed with some veggies and topped with scrambled eggs.Non oily and filling.The dish was an awesome one!!!
Baked Fish- This one I would and already have recommended it to all.The dish came in a paper envelope and it was cut open in front of us and out came a delicious dish with baked bhetki, aubergine, broccoli , mushrooms, zucchini , asparagus and kafir lime leaves!!! The dish was an absolute stunner!!! I loved the taste, color, aroma plating .. everything basically!
Going again soon!

This was our place for Nobomi lunch . 

The show stealer was the refreshing gondhoraj julep , a must! 
And the kancha aam er pie , DELISH. 

The starter was sausage in a cheesey dip the twist was the kari pata and rai phoron, sprinkled with bangali r priyo murmure aloor jhuri bhaja, where do you get these ideas @bohemia ? The prep might sound unbelievable, but do taste it to believe .

Maa ordered the pagla mamar biriyani, she was elated by the mutton pieces , she says they were melt in the mouth and the rice was flavoured with ‚Äòpaanch foron ‚Äò and made in butter I think , so very different. But a good choice .
The ghatshila chicken was spicy and hot! A great combination, the gravy was very flavourful. 

The Malpua cheesecake too was soft and had hint of malpua in it .

Starters: Prawn Tempura, Chicken Karaage

Main Course: Tori Yakimeshi, Mixed Yaki Soba, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken in garlic and chili sauce

Mocktails: Virgin Mojito

The food quality and taste was good but it didn't fulfil my expectations. The food was not at all authentic Japanese. Also the pricing is more compared to the food taste and quantity. One suggestion: you guys have a plus point about the ambience, please work on that. Try to enhance the restaurant with authentic Japanese cuisine and demand to be a Japanese restaurant.

6871,"Baan Thai has always been a very popular upscale Thai restaurant for the crowd of Calcutta. I have a fondness for Thai cuisine and believe that 5 star hotel Restaurants make the best Thai food. The decor is very classy and something that you would find in a 5 star hotel.
Though I enjoyed my meal I personally feel that its very usual and nothing extra ordinary,even the menu is very basic nothing that stands out.

What I ordered:

-Warm Asparagus Salad : I like a little bit of crunch in the asparagus which was missing but the flavor was good

-Phad Thai : very well made. Sure the seafood Phad Thai would be excellent too

-Vegetables in Ginger Garlic sauce : the mushroom used was excellent and the sauce was made phenomenally.

We ordered Rava Dosa, Filter Coffee and Coca cola. The dosa was well tossed with butter stuffed with tangy potato curry. The sambar was so up to the mark that made me overwhelmed. I'm not a South Indian food lover but this place made me fall in love with it.Talking about filter coffee it disappointed me. It was way too bitter than usual.

We stopped by the nearest stop possible and found out this All vegetarian Restaurant in Bara Bazar.

We ordered three things in our thaali.

Butter Naan- Soft and tasty, had balanced amount of jeera that contributed to the taste. Liked it, but it ain't the best naan of my life.
Palak paneer- Creamy and delicious. Had abundant amount of paneer in it, moderately spicy and it did melt in my mouth. I did customize it with the lemon ,salt and chilli provided along with the dish, because I love spicy foods. I highly recommend it.

Bundi Raita- Again creamy and delicious, bundi was crunchy . It was a little less salty but I used the salt provided according to my taste preferences. I loved this too.

9420,"I visited here for lunch at late afternoon so rush was less at that time. The place was not so big but was cozy enough. I ordered Tandoori Roti, Peas Pulao and Murg Bharta. I must say the service was extremely slow despite non peak time.

Tandoori Roti -

I was different from other Tandoori Roti found in other places as maximum amount of wheat flour was used thus it became crispy after a while. There was nothing special, just simple kind of roti.

Peas Pulao -

A very simple kind of rice with few peas (I think the price is high) and for flavor, cloves were present. It was somewhat cold. Quantity was enough for 2 people.

Murg Bharta -

Quantity was OK and was garnish with grated paneer and processed cheese. Chicken pcs were hard and small. Not much spicy but the taste was average.

Staff was good and the place was clean. Ambiance was cool and calm. Few improvements are required towards quality of the food otherwise it is a good place for a casual lunch/dinner at reasonable price.",neutral

Lacks a restroom which if you want to visit(Pay&Use) is behind Sonali Cinema which you can access via the alleyway beside the resto.Now coming to the food this place churns out some awesome food from their kitchen which definitely would satisfy your hunger prangs. Hospitality is good especially from the owner Sunny Sir,service may be bit slow especially during the time when a show breaks in the cinema above,at that time when you may find it to be bit crowded",positive

3985,"Ordered thru UberEats and frankly speaking ..didnot have any other good option.

Ordered lacha paratha , egg tarka and a chicken chaap.
Paratha was little too oily but the good part was it was oil and not dalda. One more star ,just for that.

Egg tarka was also not too spicy.. was like a home made tarka..some might like it, some might not.. i liked it.

Chap had too much mitha atar and was raw in some portion. Had to cook it again.

So might order from here as in that price ,you cant expect that good food.",positive
7404,"We went to this place about a month back. The decor is nice and so are the people serving food. They helped us in finding the right dish.

Coming to the food, I would say pretty average. The initial dishes, the starters were good. But the main courses were somewhat not that good. I took oriental fried chicken but it lacked both salt and oriental spices. The baked rosogolla was good though. The gravy noodles and the chilly chicken was okay-ish.

I may visit there again but it's a big may.

Coming to the bar, just beside the restaurant, it's just horrible. The seating arrangement is clumsy and lees spacious. The crowd, aaarrrgghhh... I will not visit here and not suggest anyone to go to the bar.",neutral

The food service was not good and food quantity was less. High price , less food quantity and late service has annoyed me very much. Music sound was low dont know for what reason. I thought place to be hot and happening but it was not. I have given 4 for the decor.",positive

I got myself one of their most popular dishes-
Murgh Polau : Not really the most appetizing to look at. But the taste was not bad. Rice was light and easy on stomach, chicken was nicely cooked. But definitely I have tried better polau elsewhere.
Pocket pinch is low. Give this place a try if you love Bangladeshi food, especially in a budget.",neutral

5046,Good for a One time experienceüëç. The food is not bad....but found the menu very limited especially for a Veg person. At the price they are charging...they should include a soup/ Dal / Papad in their menu. The interiors are on a Bengali theme and so is the music. I was expecting more professional staff.....maybe explaining about destinations reached and about Bengali culture...etc. Since we took the Dinner slot ...could not see much view outside too. The girl who was serving us was very polite. I feel a little bit of Menu fixing and professionalism could make this a gr8 concept. They even charged 1050/- for a 4 year old kid....which I found too much.,neutral

3133,"I had never expected a vegetarian place to have such delicacies. We ordered a hazelnut cappuccino and caramel cappuccino. One thing i liked that the flavour syrup was not sweet. Hence the coffee tasted rather good. 

We also ordered a Gnocchi and a plate of Pita Pizza. The Gnochhi was soft and succulent, and it was wok tossed with butter and chilly. There was a hint of lemon grass and the fresh coriander leaves made it  taste amazing. 

The simplicity of the Pita Pizza was what made it a memorable dish. Simple yet elegant. The tomato sauce was homemade. The pizza was topped with ample amount of cheese. 

Do visit this place to taste a different side of vegetarian dishes.

The biggest upset was the bill , where they charged GST, CGST, and SGST seperately. When again asked about this ,they said it's on customers will if they want to give it or not. Advise, don't try to fool people who give you business.",negative

I ordered the famous Moglai Paratha with mutton kasha. Having heard so much about these magical dishes, I expected much. Having said that, both dishes can beat the best offered in Mumbai.
I rate the paratha at 4 as they were prepared with deshi eggs and the mutton kasha 3. But the ambience is old time which adds to the charm and managed by employees who seem equally aged. The welcoming smile and the quick service beats the best.

Would rate 3.5/5

2. Mushroom Hara Pyaz - mushroom & spring onions cooked in a brown gravy. I liked the taste and the creamy texture but, it was too spicy. Every bite had chillies in it. Dominates the taste of the mushroom though. ( With masala kulcha )

As much good was kadai paneer, mutton dopyaza was levels worse .. The worst I had had in that price. 4 pieces of so called mutton had only hard inedible bones and no meat at all.

778,"This place is located on the 5th floor in A block of the Pantaloons complex in Camac street. The overall ambience is good and food is average. Most probably they have happy hours on drinks before 7pm on weekends. The thing they need to work on is there DJ. The DJ was repeating the same songs back to back which was very irritating. Service is good but one thing really sucks that is you can't leave your table empty even if you are dancing. They will allot your table to someone else and tell you to clear the bill if your table is empty and you are on the dance floor. This rule or thing is really not good. If your cafe has dancing floor then this policy should not be followed. Due to this reason my rating has fallen from 3 to 2 for this place.

I loved the starters. Both Indian and Chinese options were great. Specially liked the Amritsari Fish and Lat Me Kai. Somehow felt the tandoori items are a bit neglected. Chicken Reshmi Kebab was average and not as good as the other items.
Cocktails and beers are bit overly prized.

Staff attitude is a bit obnoxious. They need to understand everyone have their own frustration and it harms the restaurant if you are rude to your customer. I am not a regular and considering the small spat as one off incident. Others may not be that objective.

We ordered 2 chicken biriyanis and 1 mutton biriyani with a plate of green salad. The biriyani was really good with soft and succulent chicken and mutton pieces. Though there was no egg, the quantity was good enough for a single person. They also served complimentary raita with the biriyanis.

Chutney/Dhaniya raita along with it is a disappointment though. It lacks the subtlety of how it should've been and that's one basic mistake one should not make. You won't find yourself asking for the chutney as you would at other prime Muglai restaurants in city.

Chicken Lahori, well, was not chicken Lahori. Idk if they screwed up the order but it tasted more like an average Chicken Kassa.

The food was really good, do you sometimes have really good quality food and go wow this is money well spent? I felt that.
They served a really big tangy mocktail which I absolutely loved, then for starters they served two chicken legs with a sweet sauce and mouth-watering chilly potatoes with sesame seeds, the chicken legs were extremely crisp and yum. For main course they served chilly fish and fried rice and let me tell you it was the best chilly fish I tasted till now.
For dessert they served a tutti fruity shot which was really small but quite tasty.

It was full of Chicken pieces. The chicken pieces were mostly in kebab forms which multiplied its taste. They were layered with a thick gravy and onions which is the main attraction of the Rolls I guess.

I would suggest to consume it at the shop only right after serving because then it remains hot and fully crispy. The crispness goes away if you bring it home because it gets cold till then.

I visited with my family and got the cheese masala dosa, plain masala dosa and the puri. But highlight of the breakfast was this coffe at the end. It is advertised in their indoor screen as ""Dancing Coffee"" because u can see the swirling milk interact with the dark coffee beneath. But beware, it is twice the normal shot of a coffee.

Heard so much about this place from all my friends thought of trying this one. Went there with my buddy for our Sunday adda session. The nice courteous staff combined with some lively music and cute decor is sure enough to enliven your spirits while you enjoy the lip-smacking food.

What we had -

*Brownie Shake
*KitKat¬†Shake
*Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler
*Chicken Steak Sizzler

I highly recommend both the shakes. The right amount of cream, brownies and ice cream will make you crave for more. Coming to the sizzlers, I absolutely loved the¬†Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler. If you love spicy chicken wings tossed with bbq and chitpole¬†sauce, then this one is sure to blow your mind. The Chicken Steak Sizzler was also good.¬†

7849,"This place is part of the food court section in Acropolis mall. The food was made maintaining all hygiene measures and plated beautifully. But as for the taste, it lacked flavour. The sambhar was too watery and lacked flavour, the coconut chutney tasted alright but I have had better. The dhosa has thin and crispy but the stuffing in it was very little. Overall the dish wasn't quite satisfactory and would recommend trying out better places.",neutral
8640,"The black mutton kosha and rooti epitomises this joint. While people point to Golbari even when you ask them about Rupa restaurant - you gotta persevere and keep looking (it is in the opposite footpath) and it will be definitely worth. Tender mutton pieces in an oily, black gravy - it certainly isn‚Äôt for the faint hearted or the health freaks. But when you are done polishing off the plate you would feel happiness.",positive
2528,"Beautiful breakfast! Try the chef‚Äôs special preparations, made to order. The black currant French toast, eggs benedict in a bowl, everything was amazingly curated. The regular buffet was good to go, yes a bit too much oil in a few dishes, such as poha! Tea options could have been better too.",positive
5745,"Has been to this place on soshti afternoon. It was crowded just like expected on Durga puja days. We waited for sometime and were sent to 4th floor. The ambience was pretty average.service was slow, might be due to the puja rush. We ordered chicken chopsuey, mix fried rice, schezwan chicken. Mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken was decent. The gravy with chopsuey was too sweet due to excess ketchup. Chopsuey was disappointing. Might be due to rush and bulk orders.",neutral

I've visited this place with friends. we have always ordered here a large variety of food items and cuisines which has a good taste too. One big issue we always has that some of the food if not available and sometime rotis are not there and service is a little slow. they have to look into this real issue for sure. But being a local Restaurant this place do good business from good food taste to Number of food items. they have to really take care of cleanliness at the non AC section specially. otherwise good place to eat non veg too.

8732,"I ordered fish thali through swiggy. The food was delivered within 45mins which was quite commendable. The food was very neatly packed without any leakage. It had rice, alubhaja,aluposto,dal,fish and a pouch of achar as well. They had also given salad as complementary. The quantity was enough. The fish piece was quite big and the rice was of good quality. The price being really cheap made it a worthwhile experience. Will order again.",positive
7283,"Kankurgachi Dhaba is place where you can get solid gulps and chomps at a significantly low price.

They serve North Indian Cuisine and Chinese (which is almost Punjabi Chinese - if there was ever a thing like that) and use liberal doses of oil and spices.

The food here is tasty and spicy but probably something that you would not want to put in your system everyday. Order, if you want cheap spicy chicken and other stuff, made tadka style.

5736,"Had some great authentic chinese dishes there. First of all nearest chinese outlet from my home. And the chinese lovers, this place is just for you all guys. We had conjee crispy lamb for the starter, though i didn't taste it but my friends did. According to them the dish was good enough. I had conjee crispy chicken which I loved the most and chicken momo which is also my favourite one. Now coming to the main dishes where we had mixed schezwan meifoon and cantonese chicken. The meifoon was really so nice. I tried meifoon first time here and I like it a lot. The cantonese chicken was also very good in taste.
The restaurant has very nice decor along with some tibetan and chinese stuffs. Loved the ambience there. The staffs are also very polite and well-groomed.

My order included Fish o Fry, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chilli Garlic Noodle, Chilli Fish and Kungpao Chicken. Everything was prepared properly, delivered fast and tasted good. Even it wasn‚Äôt much heavy on pocket. Though you can‚Äôt say these food preps as authentic Chinese, these are prepared more to appeal to our desi taste buds. I recommend this place!",positive

1003,"By the name 'Jungle safari' it is clearly understood that it is a jungle themed restaurant! Undoubtedly, the plush d√©cor of the interior deserves plaudits. I visited during Pujas ( Dashami, specifically).You can definitely experience the ultimate wild dining in this restaurant. A must visit restaurant for children. At the entrance of this restaurant you'll see a monkey seating in a bench entering, you'll see a elephant raising it's trunk, hear a lion's roar, live waterfall if you go to a little close proximity you'll see crocodiles, tortoises and a number of wild animals! Stairs are made up of tree's trunk and they looks so real! Now, coming to the food, among the starter we had Malai chicken tikka kebab along with sweet lime soda, both were mouth melting. Then, we ordered chicken dum biriyani along with Afghani chicken masala both complemented each other so well. Ended our meal at a sweet note with a kulfi! Service was good and quick too. Will definitely visit again!",positive

7196,"Dissapointed.

It was Bhai- phota, so we brothers and sisters decided to have Biriyani, thus we ordered seven to eight packs of Biryani from A1 Haji, Baranagar, it was a great disappointment. The Biriyani rice, smelled awfully bad, the chicken pieces were also smelling badly, the potato was not boiled properly. It seemed that it was made a day or two before, and they served us that. Probably the Street Biryani Counters make much great biriyani than them. It extremely disappointed me, nobody could had their lunch that day.
And then when we went their to complain they refused to exchange. After arguing a bit, one of the staff said that they will exchange only two packs of Biriyani, we agreed on that too. But after coming back home, we realised that they gave us the same one by just serving it hot.

My opinion is that, take a bit extra money, but serve good food atleast.

Not at all recommended.",negative
679,"It is on very rare occasions where a pork serving restaurant still manages to impress me with its other dishes. On a very unlucky day where they were out of Pork Items, mainly the ones I have heard so much about, I decided to have Chicken Bao, Grilled Bhetki, Dry Chilli Chicken and few other dishes paired with a glass of neat scotch. Both the fish and the chicken melted in my mouth and you could enjoy the royalty of a Kolkata Bhetki. The staff was cordial and always smiling as if to fill up the void that was created in my heart because of no Pork. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",positive

Hungary Chicken ‚Çπ285
Toblerorone Shake ‚Çπ245
Fish Florentine ‚Çπ445
Hookah ‚Çπ295
Chocolate Cheesecake ‚Çπ225

Ordered their Veg Noodles & Chicken Manchurian combo for Rs. 89 only. The food was delivered super fast within few minutes in super hot condition.

Veg Noodles were made very authentic Chinese style with crunchy vegetables. Thick noodles tossed with very mild spices tasted very neutral.

Chicken Manchurian was spicy with thick gravy and coriander leaves on top for garnishing. 2 medium sized chicken pieces, tasted juicy and fresh with full of flavours.

Nowadays fried chicken outlets are in every corner, but most of them are below average if you keep them at par with KFC. But the food from here was way better than those from other outlets. Here i found the chicken to be perfectly crispy and the chicken was with skin (Which is very important when you are making fried chicken).

Two cons are -

1. Chickens were a bit too spicy (as in more use of cayenne or red chilli)

2. A bit over fried.

10078,"Another place I visited during the Pujas. Since this place is located just beside Maddox, no wonder we had a waiting period close to an hour. 

We ordered Chicken Tandoor, Tandoori Roti, Chicken Do Pyaza and Some sort of Dhania Chicken. We were impressed by the soft and juicy Chicken Tandoor. But we soon learnt that all the chicken dishes used basically the same chicken, just in a different curry. The Do Pyaza was a bit sweet, but the Dhania Chicken didn‚Äôt have any taste per se. The Roti was a welcome relief as they were soft Nd made out of atta, just as i like them. 

The only justification for my rating is the soft chicken, tasty tandoor and the really soft roti. This restaurant was capable of delivering a decent quantity food even with aa huge rush during tje Pujas.",neutral

Afghani rugs provide the necessary warmth helped on by the ambient lighting...and the entire stay is a complete dining experience.

5. Gondhoraaj Chicken with Ghee Paratha- This was not so great as I expected a strong flavor of the Gondhoraaj lemon, but it lacked that. Paratha was big in size and tasted good

Now coming to food, the packaging was not definitely great as you can see from the picture. Guys you need to spend a bit for brand recognition. The packaging was like it's from a local streetside shop.

I ordered their special sharmawa chicken sandwich - that tasted good but it's better that you don't order it at home, rather have it in the shop. The warm got lost, and I don't blame on them. The fish butterfly is too oily, and the kasundi was quite bitter in taste. However the mixed haka chowmin was better to tastebud, but it contains only chicken & egg, no prawn with it. It's quite dry and simple tomato sauce would not make a justice to its dryness. I would order a Chinese main course with it.

2550,We checked into our hotel and thought of stepping out for lunch. After checking nearby I came across this place a short walk and there we were. I was surprised at the entrance itself very well done up. The restaurant was empty for a weekday but I must say the ambience was refreshingly different. Cooking to the food we orders dim sums which was really good to my surprise a plate of pho and Thai green curry. The food is excellent and tasty. The pho was fresh and just the way I like it. I need to mention the staff here are very courteous friendly and go out of the way to accommodate you. A must visit if you are in the area and a welcome change from all the local so called Chinese restaurants around.,positive

A fun decor but certainly not good for photography as the lighting is very dim. Gives you dhaba vibes. We went there for chilling and had beer with tandoori chicken.The tandoori chicken was simply rustic and yum!!!! Perfectly paired with the chilled beer!!The staffs are courteous and the service was quick enough.A nice and easy on pocket place for hanging out with friends.

7342,In general I prefer to go to restaurants to have my food. But since there was a ocassion at my place so I had to order foods. For that I rely on zomato food ordering nd ordered Chinese foods from this place. Trust me they serve great foods at great price. The foods were too good nd the packaging was awesome. I loved their service. Although they took some time more than the estimated time of delivery but it's ok. The chicken in devil sauce was awesome. The Cantonese noodles was great. Both the rice were tasty nd tasted different from each other. So all in all loved this place. Next day they even call me to take the review of the foods. Loved this gesture. So if you are looking to order for some great chinese foods to nioy at ur place go for Cloud Kitchen..,positive

3992,"Went here during the pujas. We ordered brownie shake and green apple mohito. I really don't know if it was for the puja rush or something else, the brownie shake sucked. It felt like I was having chocolate shake and there was no brownie in it. They just gave some brownie which I felt were just plain chocolate cake for garnishing at the top. I was disappointed and pissed because they charged 180 rupees and gave this. The green appple mohito was still okay. But I have had much better green apple mohito n brownie shakes at other cafes which I can name as well.

The interior is good. It's a cozy place n is decorated nicely. The space is utilised properly.

If it's just for the Pujo time then I can excuse there lacking, but not visiting here again.

A note of advice for the cafe is that if you are charging such a huge amount then make sure you provide food of that level because I have had these in other places and trust me, they tasted much much better n are much lesser in price.",negative

Now coming to the java grilled fish, it was rich on spices. It tastes best with Kai pad pak. Teriyaki egg fried rice is ordinary. It is bland so it goes well with Java grilled fish as well. Japanese teriyaki chicken is also simple yet elegant. You can combine it with Hakka chicken noodles. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!

I mean it is christmas time so one should have sufficient staff available to shorten the waitng time.2ndly they dont take care of your order. We had placed order for a cappuccino but we never got it.

We had their Crispy Chilli Babycorn that was really tasty. Their corn pepper salt was also well seasoned and had a nice light crunch to it. Recommend ordering their Murg Malai Kebab if you like soft and succulent chicken :)

My personal favorite is their King fish steak and also the pork belly. Both are filling and sufficient for one person. My daughter loves their Carbonara.

The biggest disappointment was the pork belly. The crackling on top was a disaster, it was a leathery mess. The meat and fat should have been rendered better than it was when served. It was inadequately seasoned to top it off. However , the accompanying broth was good to taste.

Mrs. Wilson's Cafe is located at Ballygung beside Patha Bhawan school. It's basically a bungalow that is turned into a designer store cum cafe. The interiors have been kept very simple with colourful wall graffiti and the final touch has been given with some beautiful lights.
Again, the most important part is that the furniture and everything else in the cafe has been recycled.
According to me the most beautiful corner of this cafe is the outer seating area at the balcony. It's perfect for winter days. The calm atmosphere and beautiful neighbourhood adds to it.

We had to ask for the napkins, we had to call them to clean the table. It was like we did some mistake by going there. Food was not bad. Half of the sweet dishes were not available. When we went there, we were willing to sit upstairs. But they said that they had reservation. For the entire time we didn't see any other to come and claim for the reservation.",negative

It is a pure south Indian restaurant.
We went for lunch and ordered mini idlys a south indian thali and a Mysore dosa..
The mini idlys were jus yummy and very nicely dip in sambar.
The idlys were soft and prepeared well..
The thali had all the varieties of southindian sabji and rasam with a delicacy sweet..
Mysore dosa was a bit soggy could have been more crisp.
All in all it's very pocket friendly and a decent place for south indian lovers",positive

I had ordered hot garlic chicken and instructed it be dry but this was flooded with gravy, the taste was sweet it was not at all hot, besides the batter was too thick in comparison to the chicken pieces. The recipe needs to be checked again, if special instructions tab is to be unread it's better Zomato should remove such feature.",negative
5444,"Finally, a great Chinese food place in New Town Sapoorji area. This place in located inside DLF New Town Heights mall. Cozy, comfortable, neat and clean. Service was prompt. But let me directly go to the food. The quality of food was awesome. We ordered panko prawn (a fried prawn dish ) and chicken mono as starters. I really liked the prawn dish. Prawn was fresh and fried to perfection. Next came the main dishes e.g. Spicy Coriander Rice , Butter noodles and Kung Pau chicken. Spicy Coriander rice is the signature dish and a must try. The smell of fresh coriander coming out of moderately spicy rice was mouthwatering.   I have not had such a nice fried rice in recent times. Kung Pau chicken was soft and juicy. Butter noodles melted inside mouth. The amount of prawn and chicken in the mixed noodles was generous. We had Darshan ( Chinese Wonton Strips ) as desert. 

I plan to revisit this place to try other dishes. Do visit Chufang for amazing Chinese food at a decent price point.",positive
8942,"I quite like their food. Ordered egg-chicken fried rice and Kung pao chicken for dinner. Good quality of rice, perfectly boiled, lots of chicken pieces in it. Now the Kung Pao Chicken - tender n juicy chicken lightly coated, tasted good. Though I like the dry version of this preparation more.

Visited the restaurant twice before. They serve alcoholic beverages also. Cordial service executives. But the restaurant looks dull, they need to work on it.

They maintain their food quality consistently. Good portion as well. Very reasonable. Definitely Recommended. Golden City",positive

In frame :

Saucy Chicken wings
Cheesy Zinger Burger
Peri peri burger
Popcorn Chicken

Well coming to the food... This is absolute value for money.. The burgers have their own signature style and extremely easy on the palette as well.. The saucy chicken is totally different with chicken wings doused in the house special sauce with garlic and schezwan infused flavours. Finally the popcorn chicken also does a neat job. The peri peri sauce is also not too spicy and goes well with the Indian foodie sentiments.Alsp the packaging is a big plus with cute doodles on the popcorn chicken boxes.Definitely a do not miss outlet...

It costed me 100+20 bucks (delivery charge included).Fish batter fry was fresh ,crisp,hot and tasted awesome.Fries were good too. But the egg roll disappointed me somewhat.It was the use of excessive sauce and they used fried onion instead of raw onion.So the crunchiness and the sweet heat of raw onion was missing.But ovee all my experience with this food joint is satisfactory.",positive

Coming to the food, the starters had quite a number of varieties in kebabs sections and all were pretty well made and delicious. What was special about the starters were the two chinese starters they were simply mind blowing and you cannot resist asking for more. Then the main course had a number of varieties both in chinese and indian, veg and non veg. They were pretty good. Specially the rice items and the mutton side. The desserts have a huge number of variety and i promise by the time you reach the desserts section you would regret having just one stomach to fit in all the gluttony.

it's a small para shop which is supposed to be friendly but has a snobbish man sitting on the counter.
they have only 1 table somehow crammed into their room with 4 chairs.
I ordered dhoka, jalebi and tea. all of them were okay. jalebi tastes decent. the tamarind chutney they serve with dhokla is extremely sweet, it ruins the overall taste,they don't give any green chutney, or green chilly with dhokla.
I believe this place is better for delivery and it's worthless to visit to dine in.
I was given the bill after requesting for it.
also they won't serve anything in a single piece, you will have to buy samosas or dhokla or anything in a pair.

Totally loved the ambiance of OTT along with the music. A toast to the DJ! (Though music was too loud & I personally feel it is helpful to have at least one comparatively silent corner in a pub to take important phone calls)
Coming to food & drinks, we had nachos, pasta, kebabs, beer, cocktail & hookah.
Sorry to say .. pretty lousy service.
The staff is not well aware of the menu; they took a lot of time to understand that Jamaican punch is a cocktail & not breezer.
Moreover we were pretty hungry & had to ask them again & again what will be readily available from the food menu.
The hookah pipe was leaking & they had no clue what was wrong or how to fix it.
Also, a single common washroom is a bit disappointing in a place like this.
The good part is this place is easy on the pocket, along with good food.

Nevertheless OTT was fun!

9727,"Illusion is basically a bar cum restaurant. It is in Metropolis mall, Hiland park. We went there for 99 offer (Happy hour from Sunday to Friday). And now I know why this place has a low rating on Zomato. It is justified. The place is too much overpriced. They charge 200rs + tax for a bottle of Breezer. Most of the drinks and starters cost above 99rs. 75% items from the menu cost (49+99 & 59+99) Is this really a 99 offer.

‚úîÔ∏è Beer ( Kingfisher)
‚úîÔ∏è Murgh tikka kebab(4 pcs for 160rs)

The ambience is not upto the mark. There is also a dance floor. Hookah is available there. Even the leather couches have so many tears.

Chilli Roast Pork - I did not taste this one but the ones who did said that it tasted well.

Ambience was average. The washroom side was not very clean. Service was so-so. Waiters seemed reluctant to serve despite the place being empty.

I have ate here many times. On last visit me and my partner took mutton fried rice and mixed fried rice and a quarter of boneless chilly chicken and a plate of green salad. Both the rice was good in terms of quality and quantity however the portion of chilly chicken was not warm. Altogether one can have good food at an affordable price here.",neutral

It was bland with hardly any taste of salt. The mutton seemed to be a portion broken from a skeleton, with any hardly flesh in it. The little flesh it had was stiff and again, very less in salt. The chicken too was very stiff, don't know how old were the meat they used ! Overall, not a pleasant experience at all...",negative

Have brought food home also from here. The pricing is cheap and very much reasonable. They serve good hygenic food in pocket friendly prices which is very convenient for school, college and office goers. It is a very small joint but very fast in their service. Staff is polite. Remains mainly crowded in the lunch hour. No seating available ofcourse. But the food is awesome. Had several stuffs off their menu namely veg cheese sandwich, cheese and corn sandwich, paneer corn and cheese sandwich, buttered toasts, jam toasts, tea and coffee and cold drinks. Quantity is good for the price and fills one's apetite also. Coffee is good also for a street joint.

||Fish Roll||
Big, filled with two layers of filling. One is white bhetki filling and rolled with minced prawn and masala. It was something every Bengali would love.
||Mushroom Fritters||
We didn't expect this to turn out as good as it was. Well baked with a coating and stuffed with parmesan filling. This was a delight too.
||Cilantro Marinated Grilled Fish||
One of the best grilled fish main course dish I've had till date at any place. The parsley butter rice was so good. The wine sauce was so creamy. The cilantro paste was perfect.
I'm giving a 5 rating inspite of the average ambience and a couple of flies around because their quality of fish is uncompromised.

2268,"‚óè Location: Purnadas Road, Hindustan Park
‚óè Type: Online Delivery
‚óè Cuisine: Chinese

We ordered-

*Korean Fried Rice: This special Fried rice has a mixture of both sweet and salty flavours. Soya Sauce seems to be the primary ingredient of the dish. The seasonings though strong, the vegetables and meats are nice, fresh and juicy.¬†
*Chicken Prawn Hakka Noodles: The prawns are big and juicy, the chicken is deep-fried and a bit chewy. A bit oily than usual, yet the noodles are thick and flavourful.
*Bhetki in Chilli sauce: Bhetki fish was encased in a thick batter of cornflour. The fish though fresh and succulent; could hardly be enjoyed due to the heavy covering. The Chilli sauce is not-so-hot and plain, which is most enjoyable for non-spicy eaters.

The food quality and quantity is sufficient for 3-4 people. The cost is reasonable too. Must try for a modified Chinese preparation.

Food was good and ambience too. Our waiter was suggesting stuff nicely. We sat inside because the queue was too long to sit outside but you can sit inside and with drinks can hang outside. On the contrary I liked the idea of sitting inside and then going outside to chill. That way you can have a cosy ambience with a good light area to have your food as well. Only I thought Margarita could have tasted better. But definitely a very good place to visit for parties. The view from outside was really nice.",positive

Since we were not in the mood for something heavy, so we decided to go for the starters. We had Tandoori aloo, fish tikka and aloo chaat. All of them were good and went down really well with the drinks - specially the aloo chaat, with its right amount of spicy and tangy mix.
Coming to the drinks, they had a good spread - though a tad bit overpriced.
However, the best part was the sheesha. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have the option of the bigger sheesha's as well. Coming from Kuwait, where the bigger sheesha's are the norm, this was a welcome change from the miniature sheesha's you get in most places in Kolkata.

Ordered sweet and sour pork along with chicken fooyung or chicken omlette and the food didn't dissappointed me.

They have a very fixed menu lacking most of the Bengali delicacies and successfully ruined my Saturday afternoon lunch.
The lentil curry (dal) was cool as ice, even though we had our food at 1 pm.
The mutton curry was the worst I had in my life. It cost us 170 bucks but what they served was three cold tiny pieces of bone.
The bhetki paturi being a bit warm was still better than the rest.

802,"Visited the Park street outlet on 22.12.18

It was bustling with people and honestly this was my first time in Starbucks (i was never a fan of it though).
We ordered a Latte, The famous Java Chip Frapp√©chino, and a Red Velvet & orange cake. The total bill was ~850.
I got the Frapp√©chino for myself and honestly I've never had such pathetic drink (basically a cold coffee) before. It costed around 300 and was full of crushed ice and very bland in taste.
The only star was the red velvet cake üòç if i ever visit them again it would only be for that cake. All in all money wasted. üòí",neutral

You seriously can't have that sort of explaination for a dish that goes horribly wrong. We ordered mushroom omlette which was not that great. Flurys original open Swiss sandwich was horrible to the core. Either they don't know how a Swiss sandwich is like our they are just fooling people around. All the vegetables were overcooked and soaked in oil. Chicken filled Croissant honestly didn't taste like a heritage dish.

Coming to the main course only one type of rice was there. The salads were mixed up and same with the desserts also. The turkey seemed to be undercooked. The only savior was pabrai's ice-cream.

There were two types of soup (1 veg, 1 non veg), four types of starters (2 veg, 2 non veg), six types of main course ( noodles, rice, 2 types of veg gravy, chicken and fish items), typical desserts (brownie, darshan, 3types of icecream).

The spread looks fine within the price range but what is disappointing is the repetitive taste. The gravy of all the main course items tastes similar with slight altercation which does not surprise your taste buds. After one time you do not feel like eating anything new and everything gets bland. I felt the spread was over hyped to be honest. But I really do want to visit again for their ala carte menu.

They make really good Biryani and whenever I order Biryani I request them to provide me the Masaledar rice from the bottom of their cooking utensil as i really like it.

Their only issue is consistency of taste. On some days they are superb but on some days they disappoint you. Still I would always recommend this place.",neutral

The price is also good and affordable according to the food and the location of the restaurant. The taste was awesome. The staffs were well behaved.

They have excellent packaging including condiments.
However, the food though tasty, is way too oily.

I tried the Chicken and Shrimp Hakka Chowmein. The taste is overpowered by the strong oil content. Also, the prawns were over boiled, and lacked out on the slight subtle crispiness.
Taste: 3/5
Pocket Pinch: 130 bucks.

Moving on to the Hot Garlic Chicken, the concentration of the ingredients to the oil was negligible. The dish had oil floating all over, in addition to being way too chilly for Chinese standards.This needs way too much of improvement, and the dishes need improvement on their oil content all together.
Taste: 2/5
pocket pinch: 140 bucks.",neutral
7907,"The restaurant is pretty bad when you look at it from outside, and you are even more disappointed when you step in as the restaurant is completely vegetarian. The owners don't bother to keep much staff here as the restaurant is mostly empty and the costs have risen in the past few months which has even stopped the college crowd and the students in the nearby PG's to come and have a meal. They prefer Fatso which offers more variety or even Blossom which has somewhat the same price but offer varieties.
However, if you are a vegetarian who wants to stay away from non-veg as much as possible, this is the place for you. The Butter Naan with the Palak Paneer was delicious, and I didn't order much, so I don't have much to say about other¬†items. However, I will pay a visit again in some time to try a few other dishes as you never know what suits your mouth.

Coming to the food, the smoothie was more like milkshake, however it was excellent, taste wise. The platter consisted of two pieces of buttered toasts, two cocktail sausages, two slices of salami and ham each, two stripes of bacon, double egg fried, and a complimentary tiny pack of mazza. The portion size was good. The bacon was too hard and terribly salty, however the rest of the platter was fine. The burger was okayish, and was served with fries. The patty could have been tastier.

It's quaint and no one disturbs you while you spend a good time in their dimly lit seating area. The cheese masala dosa for rupees 100 tasted good with a good amount of shredded cheese and they serve four types of chutney with sambar which is an absolute delight. Their filter coffee for 30 bucks is a must try if you are aware of how to drink it. It just refreshes your mind. Highly recommended. The amount is reasonable and quantity is good.,positive

Never experienced such excessive use of fried cheap quality half burnt peanuts in gravy chowmein. The fish manchurian was somewhat better.

A plate of rice is served in a small bowl that hardly serves one. In the pictures below, the big bowl actually contains two plates of rice. Also, the last time we went during the pujas, we ordered burnt garlic rice, which never had even a hint of garlic in them. Even though the taste of food is quite good, this is fooling people on their faces. Very disappointed with their quantity.

The ambience takes you to a different era -the rajbaadi, with the red carpet.

The place is divided in different sections- bar,cafe VIP with a view and a cozy section as well.

They have drinks and amazing hookah.

The food on the menu are all very different from the regular menu. Must try- tandoori momo , agarwal chakna plate (with drinks)
The indian platter take you straight to Delhi.
The pasta is delicious. I was amazed with the pizza, we tried the mexican cowboy and it was one of a kind.

The BANTA drinks are their speciality..

Food - The pic is of murgh tikka kolhapuri. We ordered vegetable jhalfarezi and butter tandoori roti in addition.

Pocket pinch - 700 INR for 2.

Ambience - Chilled air conditioning, dimly lit with a miniature howrah bridge dividing the restro in two halves, and a separate bar counter and a great playlist. All you need to chillax.

Service - People are prompt but order delivery is slower than usual, but as they say ""fruit of patience is sweet"". Rate - 4/5.

Verdict - The food tasted great #GREAT and that is most important for me. My people loved the ambience and the music. I would have loved it if the service was faster. By the way they do not have an inhouse washroom, which is a great turndown.

Thump Your Feet, another vodka based cocktail that we tried was average. Gondhoraj Fish Tikka is easily one of the best dishes on the menu and is a must order item if you are visiting here. Dry Roasted Chilli Pork too was good.

Papri was fresh mixed with kabuli chana, raisins, tomato pieces, pudina chatni, fresh curd and garnished with bhujia n pomegranates. The Dahi Vada was equally good n fresh.

We ordered Mutton kabiraji¬† chicken kabiraji and mutton breast cutlet. The kabiraji was huge and very oily( and it was supposed to be like that). Since the place had no air conditioning it was a bit difficult to enjoy the meal. The breast cutlet was also quite tasty. The pricing of the items were pretty decent.

Rannaghar(kitchen) is the place from where the journey of a food start getting it's shape, it's the place where the flavours are given a name, a heart & so, does RANNAGHAR, PARK CIRCUS, justifies the name?

Oh yes it does, atleast to me.

Being a food blogger, ratings hardly matter to me.
I just indulge myself into various sections of our food industry to taste their offering & surprisingly, rannaghar is what I came across last week.
It's rated 3.6 but their quality of food justifies the maintenance of hygiene.

Ordered for their chicken kosha meal, thanks to Zomato for the WOW50.

It consisted of rice(fine quality), dal(could've been better) with fries, soyabean curry(was spicy and tantalizing) with the ultimate CHICKEN KOSHA-and for surprise, I received two leg pieces, thanks for that.
Tasted amazing.
Nothing overdone with perfect play of spices.

The overall experience was great, nice packaging.

2052,"This Restaurant is located at Southern Avenue and it is themed on our favourite Rabi Thakur. They serve some Shantiniketan style bengali cuisines which are absolutely delicious. The best part is they play Rabindra Sangeet in background all the time. Recently we visited this place and in love with its soothing ambience and amazing food.

Items we ordered from their menu :

‚óè MOCHA SHAMMI KEBAB
‚óè DOI DIYE GONHORAJ LEBUR SARBAT
‚óè BASMATI RICE
‚óè CHAPAR GHANTO &
‚óè MANGSHOR RASOLLA

Mocha Shammi Kebab is highly recommend as this was totally yum and if you are a true bengali food lover you'll love the Chapar Ghanto as well. Overall my experience was great. The service was really good. I would love to visit this place again.",positive

1121,"Finally tried their bestseller Chicken Cheese Roll and honestly the taste was very average. The chicken pieces were burnt, very small in size and even weren't enough. Also, I expected a more generous serving of the cheese especially because I paid thirty rupees extra for that. So, I can't help but say that this is an overrated place to order rolls from. Sadly, the place isn't the same any more.",neutral

668,A well decorated place with a nice and cozy ambience. Had the chicken tengri kebab and chicken biryani. I must say the tengri kebab is simply awesome. You can get every bit of its flavour with every bite. Its highly recommend. But on the other hand if you are a Kolkata dum biriyani lover then the biriyani here is not for you. The biriyani serves 4 pieces of chicken and an egg but the rice is cooked in some gravy in a frying pan. Frankly Speaking I didn't like the biriyani. The service was also a bit slow. Well you can visit this place there are others dishes to try out too.,neutral

The place might be small but the foods here are exceptional. The variety is not huge but whatever it's offering is enough to make a Bengali soul happy.
We ordered:
Dhania Crushed Chicken Cutlet (120 Rs)
Basanti Pulao (60 Rs)
Mutton Dukbunglow (160 Rs)

It's a ramshackle street side joint with rickety and broken benches placed outside for seating while the little are roasted and grilled over a flame. The bite sized litti which are small wheat dumplings stuffed with sattu and then roasted/ grilled over the flame, the charred litti with the smokiness from the fire are served together with the potato chokha , which is basically mashed potatoes with chillies and mustard oil. Also served together with these is a green chutney/ dip....all three eaten combined...tastes heavenly.After having the litti have the amazingly prepared kesaria milk tea, just adjacent.

5934,"The food is alright. Not bad neither beyond expectations. It's just fine in terms of taste and quantity and compared to the price you pay for it. I ordered a plate of chicken biryani from Foodpanda. The biryani was okay. You get a good quantity of rice , one potato and one decent piece of chicken. No egg. Since I bought it on an offer I got it at 79 INR. Hence it was well paid off. But without the offer it's 120 INR which I find a tad bit expensive as compared to the quality. Overall a decent place to order take out for the foodie on a budget.

Owned by a former Masterchef India contestant Rashi Kedia, Naariyal pani is all about same old South India food with Drama!
Tikka on the rocks for example is a dish with Mini idlis skewered to look like tikkas and blow torched on grill.
The jalebi caviars are something totally different, jalebi molecularized into caviars with the help of liquid nitrogen giving out a cold breath with every bite!

However, due to the lack of a proper dance floor barring the private party arena, people usually dont get into the groove. The quality of the drinks isn't that great and can be improved. The food quantity is a bit less but very tasty. The lasagna is great but less in amount and so is the pizza. However, the starters are just out of this world. I tried all the beers.

Chicken qorma is one of the star dishes.
All of the staff was very friendly and courteous. Service of momita was amazing, she served us very well and suggest us some good drinks and the best dishes to try from buffet.

Fuchka needs no fusion. Putting maggi in the fuchka (as done in noodle fuchka) or adding corn and cheese in it doesnt make it better! In fact it has no synergistic effect at all. Dahi fuchka that they make is okayish. However i would prefer the roadside stalls to this anyday.  Also we ordered via swiggy and they forgot to deliver quite a few things!

We went there back in September, the day they turned 3. Was craving for Chinese so thought of trying out this place.

What we had -

‚Ä¢Chicken Manchow Soup
‚Ä¢Chili Prawn Dry
‚Ä¢Mixed Manchurian Gravy Noodles

The soup was good but a bit tangy. The chili prawn is highly recommended. It had the perfect blend of spices and sauces. The noodles was also tasty.

Since it was their birthday, we got a discount on our total bill and it came down to ‚Çπ344.

Will visit again soon, try out their other variants and update the review soon. Till then, Happy Gorging!

We ordered spring roll and pasta for food both of which were quite good especially the spring rolls and we ordered for liit and daiquiri for drinks which again was very well made. Overall a great experience, lived up to its standards. The only thing which disappointed me a little was that i had informed about the birthday of the person i was with and i was told a complimentary dessert would be done but nothing was done about it. This was something not expected of a reputed restaurant. But their overall service was quite satisfactory and i would still recommend this place for a nice evening.",positive

It was lunch time and the place was almost full house, luckily just as we entered a table on the window side got vacant :) it was a nice sunny winter and the ambiance was really soothing. I will have to mention that all the staffs are very polite, warm and helpful.
We ordered ultimate Mojito and some other drink (forgot the name), Classic Chicken Nachos, Herb grilled Fillet and grilled chicken breast.
Both the drinks were above average. The Classic Chicken Nachos was the show stopper of the day ‚ù§ it was just awesome with right amount of cheese and lots of chicken on each piece of nachos. The Herb grilled Fillet was also very good. Only let down was the grilled chicken breast, the meat was too hard to even cut with the knife. Never mind. The bill was around ~2800 and we had a nice time there. Would love to visit again to try out other dishes.",positive

I enjoyed very much the three crispy,crunchy and succulent pieces of fried chicken which I had ordered online from this place.Though the restaurant took longer than usual to confirm my order, it was delivered swift by the very professional Zomato valet.

The three chicken pieces were very nicely coated with batter and deep fried in oil. These desi versions of KFC will certainly give the giant a run for its money if they diversify their menu and become more professionally oriented.

The euphoria over having good food at pocket friendly price was somewhat marred by the pathetic quality of their packaging. I think what is used for packaging roadside telebhaja should not used for delivering online orders by established shops.",positive

10160,"Cake Mixing Ceremony at The Stadel.!

Cheer up for Christmas, as Stadel brings in to you some of the lovely cakes which got kicked off with a beautiful cake mixing ceremony a couple of days ago. A moment of joy, frolic and happiness, this is one occasion where everyone gathers in, and helps out by pouring in liquor and juices on top of a huge assortment of nuts and dry fruits.

The entire atmosphere gets filled in with the aroma of the liquor and creates almost a mesmerized effect and trance upon those present. Swirl, twist and carefully ripple through your hands within the mixture and combine them as many times as you can for the liquid to be really soaked inside as deeply and finely as possible!

This mixture will then be stored under appropriate conditions, wherein it would get fermented to produce some lovely outputs before Christmas and New Year kicks in!

3289,"This was my first visit to this outlet. I ordered a Baked Momo Augratin in chicken. The server sought 15 minutes and it was delivered on time. The browned baked cheese cover was tempting and it was delicious.

But an unpleasant culinary surprise followed. The momos under the cheese cover were pan fried and the sauce was terribly pungent. I can handle spicy dishes but the spiciness was strong enough to put me off. The AC wasn't working too but I didn't really mind that as the server had acknowledged it in an apologising tone.

I find the recipe odd! Does one expect an extremely spicy dish to go under the cover of baked cheese? I expected something light and subtle.

Next time onwards, I shall stick to my choice of steamed momos and maybe thukpa.

7677,"What a nostalgic feel to sit alone by the window and have some drinks. Calcutta might have been flooded by luxurious & semi-luxurious lounges/bars, but there is always a feel good factor when you spend some time at this gems.¬†
To start with, this place is still among the cheapest bars in Kolkata. Service is prompt. The place is huge & sometimes you need to raise your voice a bit to get the attention of the waiters. Food tastes good still now. No loud music so you can have a good round of discussion with friends, partners, etc. I enjoy the place alone sitting by one of the windows & gazing at the slow moving traffic outside in the heart of Calcutta's business district.¬†

The same was outstanding in taste, but quantity is way too low because of the great stuffing comprising beans, cumin etc within pita bread and finely baked!

They also provide complimentary oregano seasonings, chilli flakes as well as mayonnaise dip. Packing is fine and prices are very high!

Recently visited this old eatery during this Durga puja with some of my buddies. The only thing can I say is, gone are the days when Blossom used to be great. We (count four) opted for three plates of egg chicken rice, one chicken manchurian and one chilli Fish.

Egg chicken rice was good in taste, so was the chicken manchurian. But the chilli Fish was below average, the gravy tasted absolutely bland.

3407,"This quaint little eatery is conveniently located in the lane beside Mouchak in Golpark. Went there on the evening of Maha Saptami and asked for two plates of pork shekhwa. The chef informed us that shekhwa wasn't available, and he enthusiastically suggested that we should try their fried pork. We agreed to his suggestion and in 15 minutes, two plates of steaming hot fried pork arrived at our table. At first glance, the quantity was drop down disappointing. The taste made up for it to some extent. The pork was well fried, was crisp, and went well with the dip they provided with it. However, 170 bucks for a handful of medium sized pork pieces, merely fried with no distinct seasoning whatsoever, is not justified. And there was quite a lot of pork fat as well in place of meat. Not a memorable experience.",neutral

The restaurant isa bit narrow. However the upper floor has AC facilities too.
We had Plain Dosas and Cold Coffee here. Dosas were good and so was the coffee. However, the sugar could have been ground more. But nothing much to complain, given the rate.

The decor is lovely so is the food. We ordered 5 dishes, out of which the chicken bao and veg fried rice with malayasian chicken curry is worth a mention. The curry was seasoned well and together with the paired accompaniments the meal elevated to a heaven of flavours. The cheesecake was but crumbly and not as light as I expected it to be but the icecream did taste heavenly. I would definitely go again. A word of caution avoid the dimsums the wrap was really doughy though the filling was flavourfull.",positive

Steamed momos were good (normal and not anything special) and the chutney was really spicy, pan fried momos were kind of sweet, may be they used too much of tomato ketchup or something (it tasted like that), I liked the Garlic rice (best of all). I don't think it's a really good place to visit for the vegetarians, we couldn't drink water from the glass as it had some smell (probably something non-veg).

The chilly chicken was different with a whitish gravy which I liked but the chicken pieces were fibrous hard and not fried. The Dragon chicken which I expected to be a starter came with gravy.

I waited another 10 mins.  After 20 mins waiting,  the guys said they were preparing...  And I literally saw them folding the momos and putting into the steamer.  I am really unhappy with the service and their false word of promise. Had to leave the place and opt for other food joints because i was really hungry and angry.

The bar department is yet to open. Seesha is available. But very less options of seesha flavours. A place which doesn't have bar section, people woud focus more on Hookah.

The best part about their spreads that I personally enjoy the most are the salads and appetizers section as over the last few visits, the main course however has been dissapointing a little with poor choices of curries and the simple lack of exotic dishes to accompany along with the biryani. Over time Eden pavilion I think needs to improve the choices for the main course which would really be a boost for them.¬†

Food :

We needed roti /Naan as main course was prepared at home ;

Tandoori Roti - Size was fine - but the Roti could have been much softer 2/5

Butter Naan - Burnt badly  - and  most of the Naans were half missing as I gues they had cut of the absolutely super burnt portion. Just cannot think how they could deliver this to a customer - pathetic 1/5

For this particular outlet, the food standard and prices are as usual but there is one problem here which is the seating capacity and table arrangements. It is a small place but at the same time too congested if the restaurant is full.
No other complaints about the food but I would personally prefer going to the other outlets just for the better ambience.",positive

Have also tried a mix veg roti combo which was normal, nothing extraordinary.
Have also tried spaghetti here, had amazing garlic piece's, only if they had less oil it would have been perfect.
Fried rice and manchurian was abundant in quantity and tasted great. Have also tried fries here which was full soggy at the time it reached me, no complains for the same though.

Only if they have their price's a bit less, I would have ordered more frequently. Consider this outlet for any corporate lunches and you won't be disappointed.",positive

Ambience was really nice, but I had to park my bike on footpath.

There I had a tamil chicken dish
Chicken Chettinad - this one is bit spicy but it perfectly goes with appam. (5/5)

Then I had Massa Stew - A karnataka dish. Tastes sweet. Very mild preparation of lamb in coconut milk. (5/5)

We pulled a seat in front and waited for our turn to come.The place is always crowded so make sure to reach early.Finally the plate of goodness arrived.The fresh out of the oven littis was served with an equally delicious chokha.The chokha is basically boiled potatoes mashed with spices ,tomato and chilli.The mash tasted so good that you would ask for a second helping.

At a steal deal of 30 bucks a plate with six ghee soaked stuffed balls ,this is sheer love.

The interior is modest but presentable with all sofa seating. Service staff is attired. I went for Chinese as this place is known for this cuisine. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken on the side. The portion size of the rice and noodles was good but the taste was average, so they didn't justify the prices. The side dish had twelve not-so-large pieces of chicken. The meat was chewy and the gravy a bit too hot though I had specified otherwise.

We rounded it off with ice cream. They had only one flavour- vanilla. So I asked to bring it with chocolate sauce poured over. They put some nuts too. It tasted good but a price of Rs 130 was quite a premium.

I won't be keen to come back.

‚óè Schezwan fried rice , again as I've mentioned that the quantity is well enough for two medium eaters.
‚óè Sweet and Sour chicken to accompany with fried rice. 8 pieces are served. Well prepared and perfect balance of spices.

Only request is that the chefs should be a bit more careful while preparing the food as I've found a small hair in the chicken. But the owner apologised for it.

Loud sound , dim lights , and pocket freindly alcohols. Seating capacity is less so avoid peak hours. Great ambience with friendly staffs. Mostly the crowd was of young bunch of people . Will suggest not to go with family here mainly at evening because they might not like loud sound.

1.mushroom cabana - 3/5
2. Churmur chat - 2.5/5
3. Peanut masala -3/5

The rolls are fantastic, the Kadhai Mutton and Chicken Bharta are delectable. But the stand out item was Mutton Stew, which was ambrosial in the truest sense.
It was my good luck that they had sent an extra plate of Mutton Stew by mistake and I felt it was my responsibility to inform them and pay for it. But on calling up, they made a lovely gesture of making it complementary for us.
Loved the food. This place has certainly relieved us of the efforts of going down to the legendary outlets at Dacre's Lane.

5396,"My first Uttarpara Zomato review is of a place with decent ambience and decent food.

We had ordered the Fish Tandoori and Chicken Lollipop for starters and I didn't really like either of them that much. The Chinese dishes that were for the main course was a bit better, especially the Sweet 'n Sour Chicken.

The pricing is marginally on the higher side and the wait time is too long, which doesn't make a lot of sense since the food is not worth it, to be honest.

The management and the waiters are hands on, which I liked. Hoping they improve the quality not their food soon.",neutral

4756,"Intended rating-3.5/5

I chanced upon this outlet by sheer luck and had the best meal in weeks, all for 200 rupees flat.

The CHEESE VADA PAV(4.5/5)is delicious although there's mayonnaise instead of cheese. But who cares when the final result tastes impeccable anyway?

The CHEESE GARLIC BREAD(5/5) is so darn delicious (quoting Mr. Ramsay). It's better than most pizzas I've had this year with the exact same taste of a well-made margherita.

The MIXED SAUCE SPAGHETTI (3/5) is way too 'saucy' but tastes fine.

Zomato did a great job with the delivery.

The prices are dirt cheap.

I'll sure as hell order from this place again.

All this go hand in hand with the quirky named cocktails.I would have to say there's room for improvement in the dessert section and getting a table here on a busy evening is a special feat.

Ordered the following:-

‚ñ™Grilled Chicken Sliders - The bun which is used in the burger is not a burger bun. It is more like the normal burger bun which you get in local stores which is clearly not the bun which should be used in a cafe. Yet it tasted good so if the taste is concerned their is no complains.

‚ñ™Chicken and Cheese Pasta - The pasta sauce tasted more like maggi masala I don't know why. But it tasted okaish. Quality was okay and it contained good amount of chicken.

‚ñ™Chicken Hot Wings - The taste of the wings was really good. I just feel the quantity should have a been a bit more.

‚ñ™Fries and Coke Combo - This combo is good. Rs 90 for Fries and Coke is value for money.

We ordered for Fish Fries, Chicken Pakoras & Coffee (Black & Normal).
The Fish Fries came with Calcutta Beckti, but the fillet inside was uneven. It was crispy fried, tasted good but the quantity of fish could have been a tad more. However, a decent buy at the said price point.
The Chicken Pakoras were crunchy with a meaty filling. It was pretty good compared to the ones available in most outlets at similar price points. A worthy try.
Lastly a bodylicious and strong coffee to end the evening.
Of course, the Adda among the group of four of us was an added bonanza over everything.
The service was good too.

Flat white coffee was perfect if you dislike foam in your coffee. Hazelnut Cappuccino was good with a nutty flavor. I was really amazed with the Dark Chocolate Zucchini Bread (gluten free). It tasted like a normal chocolate cake (really want the recipe now!)

Also tried their egg chicken roll which was unique unlike the other outlets serving rolls.
The stuffing was tandoor chicken which explains the unique taste

It's close to my college, so we have been there several times and we loved the place each time we've been there. The food is equally good. Pocket pinch is very student friendly and you get ample good food at a affordable price. Also the service is quick, neat and the staffs are so friendly. They ask for honest feedback as well after the service.
I am not too fond of Chinese cuisine but this place made me reach out to chinese food and love it only more everytime.
Great vibe and great company is all you need, isn't it?

1. Shirley Temple - 3.5/5 - It was thick and tasted
pretty descent as well
2. Crusty pepperoni pizza - 3/5 - Overpriced and
very average.
3. Sphagetti aglio olio - 4/5- I had high hopes from
this one as it is my fav dish . Although it wasn't
as bad as the pizza but i wish they would have
made it a bit more spicier.
4. Hazelnut cappuccino- 4.5/5- My favourite one
from the day. I had actually ordered a latte but
since they were out of it i went with the
cappuccino and i wasn't disappointed.

Looking at their service we only ordered a tandoori chicken even that took ages to come and that too partially cold. Even it took another 15mins to get the bill settled.

Non - veg in the sense that I ordered two different fish items. Both tasted exactly the same! All the different items....whether it is Quorma or Qualia or Kosha....tastes quite the same actually.
This has always been a common problem for most mediocre eating joints. Whether it is a chicken item or a mutton or a fish item, there is just one omnipresent gravy. Everything goes in there and gets served in separate bowls! That's the only difference.....
But still....the gravy was not bad at all....that one omnipresent gravy was indeed quite tasty.",neutral

1824,"It is located in the ITC Sonar hotel.
Parking - free valet parking.
Food - The reason I choose this place for dinner was because of their famous dal bukhara.
I ordered combo 'single dinner menu' price 1750 INR.
I still have the taste of dal bukhara. I preferred the dal bukhara over all other dishes on my table.
The murgh khurchan is a unique prepared dish.
The starters were good too.
Raita was prepared simple. Onion, tomato, cucumber pieces kept on the curd bowl.
Sweets dish included gulab jamun and that was tasty too.
They suggested me to have the food without cutlery and I emjoied this concept.
Drinks - The mocktail drink was amazing too.
Paan is complimentary kept at the entrance.

941,That should be 4.5 not 4.¬†Not much to add to the great legacy of Mitra Cafe. Just reach Mitra Cafe by at least 5pm if you want to lay your hands on those famous brain chops that are an absolute party in your mouth. Fish Kabiraji comes next. And of course the legendary Diamond fry. Yet to see anyone serve boiled potato as side with kashundi so that too makes Mitra Cafe a one-of-a-kind place that is backed by quick service and affable waiters. They have marketed the name quite well but I somehow feel the authenticity can be felt only at the original place. So head out to Mitra Cafe Shovabazar for an evening snack with a difference.,positive

I was disappointed as I couldn't find any trace of cheese in the chilla and it was too bland.

2. Fish Fingers - very strategically priced 4 for 80 , the taste is nice..

3. Mutton Chop - One of the items which i liked the most.. mutton chop was very nice and flavourful

4. Special Mughlai Parantha - It ruined everything , everything about it was bad , it was too oily , it was too salty , the filling was not tasty , the alu sabji which accompanied was not tasty either .

The dish contained curry leaves and the typical flavour which every south Indian gravy carries.

And the mighty 'potato', which a Bengali will never compromise with, was really well-cooked and soft. It was served with a small bowl filled with raita and ring onions.

Mix Fried Rice -

It contained prawns, egg and normal veggies. Exotic chinese taste with balanced contents.

This place is spacious enough..can hold almost 70 to 75 people at a time. I personally love their roadside seats.
We tried different types of fried rice,fish and chicken items. Food quality is good mainly fish items, quantity is good enough, price reasonable. But their chicken items taste average.
It would be good if they add some more variety in their menu card. We were looking for more variety items in their list.",neutral

Never tasted such a super sweet chicken preparation in my life.Though all the necessary ingredients were in place, but the sweet component of the gravy overwhelmed the flavour of all other spices.,""Chicken payasam"" would have been the apt name for such syrupy sweet chicken preparation.Still I am giving 3/5 rating to the food because of unique tandoori rotis they prepared. Never tasted such soft, melt in the mouth rotis in my life. The dough was perfectly kneaded after mixing all ingredients in right proportion.The wonderful rotis negated the bad taste the supersweet chicken gravy had left in my mouth.",neutral

The ambience is kind off cute with small tables and beautiful crafts around the place and graffiti around the walls. With blues playing in the background and lights above your table, the ambience is beautiful.
About the food, the food is pretty decent here. I had the Quisedella Pasta and Fusli Alfredo and they were pretty good. The pasta was cooked well with small chicken pieces it was great.

The waiters were well behaved and kind enough to make us taste their new launch which is about to be in this Durga Puja (2018), basil rice ( Non veg).

I must say that the burgers they serve are way better than the KFC burgers. Chicken Soupy Noodles is a must try if you love authentic Chinese Cuisine and Pan fried Chicken Pops which was suggested by them tasted heavenly. The basil rice was topped with some chicken pops and it also tasted good.

5655,"I quite liked their egg thali. Unlike most restaurants who skimp on the portion of rice, Rannaghar sent very generous portion.I liked the dal which had nuts in it, the 'jhuribhaja', and the egg curry(2 eggs) as well. Well, ofcourse, I would have preferred some sabzi other than bhindi, but overall, it was satisfying.

Edit- I have re-rated them to reflect their perceived lousiness in dispatching orders. Encouraged by their previous delivery, I ordered 'Elahi veg thali'. They didn't pack chutney. Now if you do not have the attention span to pack all the items meticulously, why keep such an elaborate option? The thali costs 220 and chutney alone costs 50/-.

And if their idea was to skimp and cheat, then this re-rating has been bang on buck.",negative

The menu is an extensive one and we opted for honey glazed pork(‚Çπ310), Coriander and burnt garlic mixed rice (‚Çπ250) and upon our request for a prawn item with white gravy, they recommended cilery and wine prawn (‚Çπ420).

Fish Fry: Well in Kolkata no restaurant can really make a bad fish fry I guess. But theirs is definitely one of the best.

Fish Butter Fry: This one is my absolute favourite. It definitely is very oily. But equally tasty too. The fish inside is cooked beautiful and the batter provides a good crunch.

Fish Finger: The stuffing is good. And hence is the fry.

Aloo bhaja: I have a strong weakness towards jhujhure aloo bhaja. It always reminds me of Maa. And they always make me happy by having it.

Ambience : A small quiet place with cane chair. The wall is filled with beautiful art. Also have guitar for visitors . If you want some games, you can also get it. There are some indoor games and also story books. A very nice place for gossiping .

Food : We ordered cold coffee, oreo shake, virgin mojito as a starter. Then we tried French fries, grilled chicken sandwich which is very good in taste also had cheese omelette, pork chops, sausages, chicken wrap. Service is a bit slow but food is tasty.

We ordered
1/ Mixed Hakka noodles (4/5) : Noodles were surprisingly good compared to the price
2/ Chicken volcano (5/5) : This is the best it on their menu and most famous too. Must try.
3/ Garlic Yam mein (2/5) : Yam mein here lacks smell and flavour which we find in other Chinese eateries.

The place is rat friendly. Rat comes in and out of the restaurant.

The area outside restaurant is dirty, which makes it unpleasant. However the Food is good.",positive

Machhli Baba Fries is what they have christened this venture and have built up quite a reputation for themselves in this short space of time. No doubting the quality of food served, but they will be better off increasing the size of the portions. The fish items are class, but the other ones (read: chicken), though not bad, fail to match their fish counterparts. So, there is a scope of improvement in that department. The Dimer Devil is another item to savour. Food is prepared in utmost hygienic conditions too and that is a huge positive. The mustard sauce (Kashundi) that they provide along with the savouries has quite a knock out punch....by far the best and that too by quite some distance.
All in all a good place to order from and they can only get better.",positive

The spaghetti dish tated really nice but I doubt whether they have used the spaghetti pasta or not, considering the thickness of the noodles.

However, the continental kitchen remains closed during Durga Puja time. The staff are pretty friendly. My personal favorite over here is the Baked Fish. I prefer the one without tomato. The turkey preparations during the Christmas season are also pretty good. The ground floor is for family. If you are with friends, you can opt for the first floor, however the first floor is a bit shabby and the ceiling is pretty low!!! However, this will always be one of my favorite places.",positive

Chicken Fritters was pretty good as starter recommendation, tosted with salsa sauce.
Maharani pulao paired with Mutton kasa was simply mesmerising and on the other hand Daab Chingri was simply bang on.

Located in Hatibagan More,this place has maintained that same retro feel and ambience that it used to have even the times of our grandparents. The ambience might not resemble the ones at cafes,but you're undoubtedly gonna love it. The service is pretty quick. I've been there many a time. I love their fish kabirajis,cutlets and fish fingers all of which are available within unbelievably reasonable prices.",positive

4455,"So, my friends and I have visited this place today. It is a small eatery near Ravindra sadan brand factory. We ordered chicken pan fried momo(both steamed and fried). There were five pieces of momos but they were so big that two plates of momos would be sufficient for three. Now coming to the taste, they were succulent and stuffed with really good amount of minced chicken. The sauce was spicy-tangy and heavy. The soup needs a little bit more of seasoning.
Overall, a decent experience.",neutral

Finally when I visited the place on a weekday afternoon last year, the ambience caught my eye. The interior is so beautifully done with warm light and greenery here and there that you feel like sitting there and have a relaxed chat and enjoy the food peacefully.
Coming to the food...ordered for Kiwi mint smoothie, and a cucumber lime cooler and Couscous salad for starters.
For mains it was Chinese style paneer with soba noodles and wheat penne in red sauce. In one line the food tasted clean and refreshing...I can tell that the ingredients were chosen carefully and attention paid to every detail.
Ended the meal with a chocolate dessert...can't remember the name but it was one of the best I tasted in a long time.

Hope to visit again soon...they have added new items to the menu...looking forward to that !",positive

The combination of sesame seed,cashew and poppy seed paste was mesmerizing. The gravy looked tantalizing due to its eye catching colour which was achieved by using Kashmiri Mirch in generous proportions though it made it a bit hot.However, all good work was spoilt due to the poor quality of mutton ,which is entirety unexpected from Saffron. I think this kind of hard, undercooked, bony mutton pieces only gives a bad name to the eatery. The management should be careful about it in future.",negative

1) Super late delivery. They took close to 3 hours to deliver.
2) They charged us with more than the prices mentioned in the e-menu of Zomato.
4) They imposed a delivery charge, although, our delivery spot is barely 15 minutes away from the restaurant.

Orders :
1) Chicken Biryani-Had a generous quantity of rice, one large piece of chicken, a soft boiled potato and a boiled egg. Tasted decent.
2) Chilli chicken-Regular taste nothing noteworthy
3) Chicken Manchurian-The remarkable thing was generously large chunks of chicken and 8 such pieces. Value for money!",neutral

A new outlet in the very heart of Gariahat, this one is a delightful surprise. Nice, clean and good ambience - what more do you want from an eatery?
I ordered the pizzeria pasta and I must say that it is one of the better pastas I have had in the city. You can clearly taste the pizza type tangy tomato flavour in a slightly creamy sauce. Topped with olives and cheese, this is one dish worth trying. Although I could eat only one dish here, I think I will frequent here to try their varied menu.",positive

Firstly, a thumbs up to uber that they delivered from kalikapur to salt lake in 50 minutes.¬† Coming to the food, the chicken reshmi kabab was very average and nothing special. In fact , the chicken pieces were not that juicy and tender. But, the mutton biryani just made up for the average kababs. I will rate it the 2nd best biryani in Kolkata, the India restaurant definitely being the best. The ingredients were good, less oily, the aloo and the mutton pieces perfectly cooked and soft, the subtle spice...overall it was a perfect biryani experience. As Arsalan and Aminia have lost their charm (and the variations of Kolkata biryani which Kabuliwala and Oudh 1590 serve does not excite my taste buds as much), if Enamiah stays this consistent with their biryani everytime, perhaps they will be at par with India restaurant in my books. Go give their biryani a try.",positive

I ordered two items.

‚úî Starter: Kung-Pao fish-The fish was cooked to perfection and an amazing starter with very minimal amount of spices, chunks of bell pepper along with onions. I am still drooling over the tenderness of this dish. The addition of cashews added sweetness to it which was complementing the taste of the fish.

‚úî Meal: Garlic Chicken and Veg-Fried Rice-Combo-This is one of my favourite combination. This duo comes with five pieces of succulent gravy chicken along with fried-rice which is fresh and not so oily. Therefore, contributing brilliantly to your appetite.

1. Chilli Garlic fish: Boneless pieces of fish, batter-fried and cooked in a spicy- sweet and sour sauce. The fish portions were soft and juicy. The softness of the fish along with its hot and tangy flavours triggered our taste buds. The sauce was neither too spicy nor too sweet. We will try their other Chinese, Thai and Asian preparations sometime soon. This restaurant is definitely worth a try.

The best part about the rolls these people make is that they are very light on the stomach. You can have one of their chicken rolls and walk a mile, it's so light and non oily. The taste is not compromised either. The chicken pieces have a subtle smoked flavor and once wrapped up in those soft parathas,appeal brilliantly to one's taste buds. Recommended!",positive

We took 1 mutton biriyani ,1 chicken and baby corn soup , 1 hong kong style chicken fried rice , 1 lemon chicken , 1 chilli fish , 1 mixed fried rice and 2 tandoori roti and mutton kasha ..

Went for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon and opted for classic Bengali main course like chingri maach er malai kari and sorse pomfret and I would say I didn't expect the food to be so tasty. Everything was fresh and hot and everything came to our table pretty fast. 
The only thing which lacks in this joint is the lack of decent service.. The attendants were grumpy and sleepy and they lacked any kind of interaction whatsoever. There were times when I was alone in the restaurant and none of the attendants were present in the dining area. 
The restaurant will do great in future solely because of the quality of food they serve and it would be an added advantage if they can take the service seriously. Because when one goes to eat out not only food but the quality of service also matters a lot.",neutral

The taste of food is average, but fresh. I expected atleast a rasam and one more veggie to go with the rice and poori. Anyways, its not disappointing either, as rates are reasonable. Its a busy street eatery and basic in approach. One of those few places in strand road where you can sit, order and be served a peaceful meal.

The #Fried_Rice had the perfect Chinese essence in it that I mostly search for but rarely get it. #Chilli_Chicken was also good, it was served warm and had a good quantity. Both the #Biriyani were good in taste only I felt the mutton was a bit smelly though my friends didn't find it anything like that.

The staff was friendly and the entire experience was good.",positive

However, one thing that you would really complain about the place is the cost. Also, the ambience is not something that you would die for. The staffs too are good, helpful and good at communication. However again, the wait time for your food is just a bit too much. I had been there a few days back and I was not particularly happy with the type of service that I have had overall. Although once again, the food was really authentic.

I'd describe the food here as- Starters have less options, maincourse is okayish, dessert makes up for starter and main course. Dessert section here is loveeeely! üíï
Okay, now I need to say something about the buffet here. Nearbuy app coupons were available for Alfresco lunch buffet at 799 per person.

Hospitality here is, hands-down, awesome. The ambience is amazing too.
Pro tip: Go at sharp 12.30 pm (That's when the lunch buffet starts), then you'll have ample time in your hand. Buffet closes at 3 pm. Eat to your fullest in this 2 and half hours and you won't regret. ü§ó",positive

The main issue was that there was no difference between veg cheese sandwich and veg sandwich..Both were same..Even the cheese was less in quantity..If they charged for extra cheese then there should be extra layers of cheese..Nextly the breads were grilled but not properly..Otherwise i will give them a good rating..

There should have been more staff for serving food also the kitchen should have be quick to pass on the dishes so even the one waiter was not sitting idle when people were asking for the next item when they were done eating what was on their plate. Hence these people are unprofessional and it will be dicy to go to this place for anyone. Put your money where there is worth, this place is just not to visit again.

A clean washroom is a thing that restaurants should put some importance to. And, Aafter 9 gets a big 5 in this matter. They have clean washrooms separately for men and women.

I hope they bring some improvements and serve better food. Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pan fried Chicken Momo - Really good sizes, and a very tasty gravy. But the filling was ""bakwas"". I could find a lot of onion, very little chicken. The filling had a almost no seasoning. The momos had a very thick skin. If the owner is reading this, I would suggest them to reduce the size of the momo, and finely chop the fillings so that they can use a thinner momo skin.

Ordered chicken hot pepper soup, pan fried chicken Chowmein and another chicken semi gravy dish. The food and the quantity is sufficient for two people. Taste wise was nice and the best part is obviously the ambience. Eco park closes early but the restaurant serves till 10pm, after which they provide you with a small motor boat to ferry you back to eco park for the exit. I loved the food, ambience and service.

And ever since they had a makeover, it has become all the more better. However, being a local resident of this area, I had the good fortune of seeing the kitchen of this restaurant from close quarters and I shall tell you that I was not pleased with the hygiene. Following that, I've never gone to this restaurant again. But its impossible to deny that the food here tastes really good.",negative

Though it has both Indian and Chinese cuisine to offer, Chinese is mostly preferred here. The ambience is a bit dark and shabby lacking vibrance. The service is moderate and lacks efficiency. Coming to the food which surpassed everything negative..... We ordered FISH GOLD COIN (‚Çπ276) and CHICKEN PAKORA (‚Çπ155) in starter. 8 pieces were served in each item which tasted heavenly. In main course we opted for MIXED FRIED RICE (‚Çπ180), CANTONESE CHICKEN (‚Çπ175) and HOT GARLIC FISH (‚Çπ210). Again 8 pieces were served in each side dish. All of them tasted amazing and hot garlic fish was beyond amazing. The quantity they provide is more than enough for two.

2785,"This restaurant have been an integral part of
Sodpur for quite some time now! The Food that they serve is really something is cherished. I had placed order at home and here is my experience.

Crispy chicken: Perfect! Well, that is exactly as you can explain it. The crispy chicken was perfect. A crispy layer of coating and a juicy chicken wrapped inside it is something that would have taken anyone by a delightful surprise!

Tandoori roti: Well, as it happens mostly when u get your food delivered at your place, the roti are all cheery, but that was not the case here! The rotis still appeared to be soft and had the flair of the food served.

Chicken Bharta: It was good to taste, but yes was too spicy which would have been avoided. I take away one star from the restaurant because of this!

Delivery (by zomato): 5/5

The drinks are moderately priced w.r.t similar Restaurants.

The variety of Non Vegetarian Starters they serve with the drinks do a world of good.

The ordered dishes were superbly done.
Kebabs with just perfect grilling. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. Fish Tikka Masala and Palak Kadhai needs a special mention.

I had heard about this place long back but couldn't manage to drop in till a couple of days ago..

Beautiful decor portraying the works of one and only #SatyajitRay and serving a variety of continental delicacies - it greets you with an old world charm the moment you step in..

I had very little time in hand and not much of an appetite since I had gone for a meeting - thought of settling down with a dessert and thank God I did so..

This #CaramelCustard was one of the best that you get in town specially bcz of the cream that it is topped with unlike anywhere else I have had it till date - makes it an even more delicious affair indeed.. Would love to go back soon to try out the remaining delicacies on the menu..

My humble two cents: #MUSTTRY

The decor is simple and soothing. There are two sections, one with tables and chairs which feels a bit crammed. The other section is one where you can sit down on the floor and also enjoy a handful of board games with your friends.
Coming to the food, I had visited this place first in January, when I had ordered baked beans on toast, potato wedges, pan cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce and cafe special veg pizza. All the dishes were very good.
I visited this place again a few days back. We ordered:
1. Go green, red and yellow platter. The saut√©ed vegetables tasted good, however the cottage cheese had a bland taste
2. Veg super bowl with quinoa and cottage cheese. This dish tasted similar to the first one and not that good too.
3. Banana peanut butter shake. This was the best among the three. It was thick and chilled and delicious.

I loved the food though I felt the Chicken in Madras Masala had more french fries compared to the amount of chicken.
I am giving this a 3 star because the service was really slow and our waiter had totally forgotten about the last item we had ordered. We had to sit for about an hour to realise that they were not making our dish. The service was so slow that we thought that we'll get our dish.

Come to this place, enjoy the hospitality, enjoy the food and also enjoy a bit of North Calcutta culture...

5. Mushroom hakka chowmein (4.5/5): Taste wise very good but it needs to reduce the oil content . Also, there is some problem with the quality of prawns used.Need to work on that else it is good.

6. Hot garlic chicken (4.5/5): Tasty

Sandwiches were accompanied with lays chips and ketchup. Actually sending packaged chips instead of loose chips for delivery is a great idea as it prevents the chips from getting soggy.

In particular, the alu-bhindi (a common dish not usually noted), a Rajasthani daal (which reminded me of kadhi), the daal-baati-churma, and a halwa with apples stood out among the rest. There was also an excellent garlic pickle on the side.

I'm never ordering from here again... especially because my parents nor my aunts and uncles could stand the spices...I would not be recommending it to anyone either...,negative

6836,"Vanakkam is a pure vegetarian restaurant known for serving good South Indian food.

Location: This place is located near Maniktala post office. It is easily accessible by both public and private transport. Parking facility, however, is not there. Rating: 4/5

Ambience: This is a small restaurant that serves around 20 people at one go. The cleanliness needs thorough improvement. Rating: 2/5

Staff: The staff is friendly and caters to the customers well. Service is quick. Rating: 4/5

Food: We had ordered 3 paper masala dosas. The masala lacked salt. The dosa was crispy. The chutney and sambar were lip-smacking. They serve the best chutney in town, I must say. Rating: 4/5

Overall, we finished our dinner at a pocket pinch of INR 450.

9851,"I ordered 4 masala dosas from this outlet via swiggy  and though we received a perfectly packaged delivery but shockingly the food quality was the worst I have ever had in the south India food genre. The dosa was undercooked, the sambar tasted few veggies in a boiled water with some turmeric and the masala in the dosa was equally painful to gulp. Just because we don‚Äôt have a habit to waste the food we had it. The sides (coconut chutney, normal chutney) were cold and below average to its expected taste exception being the special coconut chutney which was cold too but the taste was fine though this item was an add on with extra money!!

7261,"It is a worth try for any fish lover. Commendable guts to serve only fish dishes and maintain its own. I was pleasantly surprised with most of their offerings. The Makhmali kabab (bhetki) is a house speciality and was a real treat. Special mention goes out to gondhoraj bhetki if white sauce doesn't scare you. The highlight of all the main dishes for me was the Booal kalia. If you care for dessert, the chocolate phidni is a must try. It is a place highly recommend. But have your alternate choices ready as they don't have all kinds of fishes available as listed in their menu. This was my only gripe. The service though was top notch and they sounded apologetic when we repeatedly met with disappointment as so many dishes we were asking for weren't available.",positive

Chicken Penne Pasta mixed sauce was pretty good. It was spicy, full of loudness which dances on your tastebuds. While the noodle version was tasteless and felt like dipped in a poop of sauce and oil. It lacked not only anything related to pasta but whatever it were, it did not taste or felt quite alright. One should stick to penne here.

Blueberry sundae, well, was more of a mirage. The cup was full of ice cream and cream with cheesecake only to be found somewhere on the bottom of the glass. Not that it didn't taste good, but it's quantity of blueberry cheesecake was almost negligible. A maximum of 3 decent scoop will make it disappear into thin air.

The Biriyani was the star of the show for me and hence it is a must try. We also had their mocktails i.e. Humpty Dumpty and Out of Control out of which Humpty Dumpty is on the sweeter side and the other one is a bit tangy.

Food : Good Italian dishes are served here . They have lot of options , usually the dishes you won't get elsewhere. Though I found it decent but can improve upon the taste. I have tried their pastas like arabiata , Alfredo, grilled sandwiches, green tea and the dessert called choco quicksand . This dessert tastes good and looks better !

Ambience: The decor is snug . But it's a small place with hardly 4 to 5 tables.

Hospitality: There are less staff so sometimes it takes too long to be served. Can improve upon this.

Nice place to stop and grab some Italian dishes .",neutral

4154,"‚ÄãDada Bhai Hotel is located just beside sub urban legend for Biriyani - Dada Boudir Hotel. It's less crowded compared to Dada Boudi and yes they sell biriyani too. People buy from them when the queque at Dada Boudi's is too long or biriyani of dada boudi's are all sold. But here biriyani is not bad - comes with decent portion of rice, good piece of meat. But price remains same as adjacent famous biriyani shop.

However I don't like biriyani of both shops. Rather I consider Dada bhai's pice hotel section is highly underrated. They serve quite a good rice meal at noon. Fish/Chicken/Mutton meal is bit pricy but actually good.",neutral
5126,"We were looking for options to order some dinner last week and decided to order from this newly opened restaurant in New Town. The delivery time was ok but it was really disappointing food. The chicken biryani was not good at all. For someone whoz charging an amount equivalent to Kabuliwaala (200/- a plate for chicken biryani), the portion size was less and the biryani was flavourless. The chicken was hard as a stone.

Not a recommend from my end. Azad Hind is a much better option for Indian Food delivery in the area. And after this experience, I am definitely not trying their Chinese..",negative

‚úîÔ∏èThe Kolkata Biryani was good, the dessert was alright, nothing great, mocktails were average, hookah was good though.

The thing which I didn't like was that they never asked what amount of vodka or whiskey would we like they simply gave 60 ml to everyone. The kingfisher storm was not good. Didn't like that beer. It was very fizzy. The chakhna they gave was sufficient. Else everything was good.

The pizza stole the show though, with the thinnest crust i have ever seen and the edges having a great smokey and burnt feeling. An authentic pizza i would say, not the Indian kind we get everywhere else.

They have the fastest service i ever saw, we didnt have to wait for even 5 mins before the food arrived.

Main Course
We ordered the Special Dal Tadka and the Aloo Do Pyaza with some Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. The Daal was made very well with some great flavours which paired very well with the Crisp Tandoori Roti. The Aloo Do Pyaza was quite different as it was topped with some fried onions which elevated the side dish to a whole new level. We understood why its one of their signatures and cleaned out the plate for this one along with some greasy(but tasty) Butter Naan.

The mohito was good too. But the rice, was too bland. Packchoy wasn't to my taste.
The staff was polite and decent, but felt clueless about the dishes. Pricing wise it was around 700/head without alcohol. The ambiance was nothing too great either.

- Fire and Ice
- Paneer Croquettes
- Cannelloni Florentine
- Apple Pie
- Chocolate Mousse

Both the shakes were excellent, it was perfectly made. Fire and Ice was a spicy mocktail, it was something innovative which would be loved by the people who likes spicy and tangy food.

Coming to the Food, i found both the dishes to be a bit bland for my tastebuds. It should have been a bit spicy and more flavorful.

Apple pie was served with a scoop of ice cream and it tasted good. While Chocolate mousse tasted just ok.",neutral

Its in the ground floor of quest...
Sitting arrangements are very comfy...but the staff service are way too slow...

I ordered

The Health Lovers Chicken : which is a portion of grilled chicken breast tossed in pepper sauce and serve with mashed potatoes and veggies...the steak was hard but the sauce and the mashed potato was yum!!

Caramel baked cheese cake : Sadly it was a bad choice...the cheese layer was way to hard and spoiled the dessert...

In short not really impressed!!

We had-
Masala Dosa- it was just perfect and they are great at their service. As we had ordered for the masala to be seperate but they got it together. The supervisor made them change it before we even complained.
Onion Chilli Cheese dosa- I was actually scared to order this because I am not much fan of onion. But the perfect balance of onion chilli and cheese was just great.
Kulfi Falooda- that's another one which I just fell in love with. The falooda and the cream was not very sweet but soothing. And there was a lot of dry fruits topping.

Called into the restaurant after in the queue for an hour at least. Half an hour later, food order still has not been taken.

1045,This is one of the new takeaway joints in the city. I ordered from this place. They serve north indian and mughlai dishes. Packaging is pretty good. The food was really hot when it arrived. Now coming to taste. The tandoori chicken was tender and juicy. All the pieces were nicely coated with spices. They served one mint chutney and a garlic chutney along with the tandoori. Garlic chutney was quite unique and flavourful. Mint chutney was okayish. Next coming to biriyani. The taste is quite similar to that of the kabuliwala biriyani. Biriyani is accompanied with raita and salad. Next we tried the plain nan and chicken kadai handi murg. It was listed as one of their bestseller. The chicken pieces were tender with big chunks of capsicum and onion in the gravy. Overall a nice experience. Will again order from this place soon.,positive

Their ambience is nice and located at a quite and calm area. A good place to visit with freinds or family based on ambience.
Coming to food, first of all they have very less options in all the varieties. You dont have much to choose. We were in a group of 6 people hence got a chance to try most of the items from their offered menu. Dosas are okay, not good not bad. The taste is average. Sambhar is nice but their coconut chatni can be made much better. Vada is much below average. We had ordered only two vadas for 6 people yet that was difficult to finish. Idli is fine again, not good, not bad. We ended with filter coffee which was good both in quantity and quality wise. Overall our experience in food was not upto the mark.

Quantities were value for money and the foods taste quite good actually. What I didn't like was, what they used in pepperoni pizza was more of salami than pepperoni.

They also have an option for Shisha, but they don't have a menu for the same so remember to ask the price before hand in case to avoid a confusion later.

In terms of cost, it is not much on a higher side. They also have there own offers going on. You can opt for them in case you donot have a gold membership.

If all things done right, it has the potential to become one of the happening places in the city.

Panna cotta is soft and smooth. The chicken in peri peri chicken and steak was soo soft and the garlic sauce the the steak was sooooo goooooooood.

We went there yesterday evening.. We were pretty much satisfied with there quality of food..
We ordered,
#Crispy Fried Chicken Chest
#Crispy Fried Chicken Leg
#Chicken Burger
#Medium French Fries..
The food quality is really well..
The bun of burger is very soft, and the chicken is nicely tender and properly seasoned..
Crispy Fried Chicken is really good.. We didn't expect that much tasty chicken.. It's served with tomato sauce and spoon full mayonnaise..
And the French Fries were also good..
Only cons we have found are, they can serve some more mayonnaise and more lettuce with burgers..
And the ambience is quite okay, exactly like a street corner food stall..
And they have some seating arrangements too..
You can have exactly food like ""KFC"" in a very pocket friendly and tasty way..

The Patropora Mutton was also juicy and tasty but it could have been cooked a little bit more. The Wild Red Rice tasted good and was a nice pair to the Banspora Chicken. The Malyasian Seafood Rice could have been given a bit more attention cause the taste was a bit off for me but still nice. And finally, the Squid was a also a Star; crisp on the outside and a bit chewy on the inside, the taste was quite to my liking!

5879,"Seven of us decided to revisit Memory Lane in the form of Jimmy's Kitchen, last Sunday.

If there's one iconic dish that is most representative of Jimmy's, it is the Chilli Chicken, IMO. A couple of plates of these were ordered as starters and a long forgotten taste sensation reawakened. Simply stated, it was far and away the best chilli chicken I had tasted in a long, long time.

The Mixed Hakka Chow that came with Sweet and Sour Chicken next however, had way too much dark soya sauce and sort of broke the spell that the Chilli Chicken had woven. The Sweet and Sour was quite toothsome, though.

Next was the turn of the Mixed Gravy Chow, paired with Roast Chilli Pork. The Chow was okayish. Suffice to say, I've had better, elsewhere. The pork was well made certainly. I wish the meat had been less lean and chewy and the fat element, a little more.",neutral

The size of it was gigantic enough for a single person to have it and get filled up for nothing more to eat. The fish inside was fresh and soft and and the layer or filling and egg inside was thick enough to make it taste heavenly.

Masala Dosa & Lemon Rice @ Krijuss, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Situated around the junction of Phool Bagan and Beliaghata, Krijuss is a recently opened vegetarian restaurant that serves - South Indian, Chinese and Sandwiches.

Being always on the lookout for good South Indian outlets, I parcelled Krijuss's Masala Dosa and Lemon Rice for tasting.

The Dosa came with the customary Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and Onion-Tomato Chutney.

The Masala Dosa was uniformly cooked without any burning around the edges and had enough Aloo Masala stuffing inside. The Onion-Tomato Chutney was fresh and tasted better than most of the other local South Indian eateries. The other two accompaniments were average. The entire dish tasted nice.

The Lemon Rice was infused with enough peanuts and curry leaves. It was well cooked and tasted good. The quantity parcelled was more than enough for one person.

Price of Masala Dosa: Rs. 90/-
Price of Lemon Rice: Rs. 70/-

After many years while passing by, on a rainy afternoon the fond memories just dragged me inside the establishment. The ambiance is still the same at its basic, no frills or cutlery. But what matters over here is the food. Was curious to know if the taste is still the same or deteriorated with time. As an old habit ordered my all time favourite combo of Special Fried Rice and Roast Pork.
Ummm, the same taste of the flavor-some meaty fried rice and smoky soya sauce chili double fried succulent pork they are still consistent with its flavor. For Tung Nam fans must try out pork here.
They don't accept plastic money or e-wallet. Prices in the menu are including tax. Each portion was enough for two of us to share. Pocket pinch was only INR 520 inclusive taxes.

Quality/Taste = Very ordinary
Quantity (Size of the Portions Served) = Hilarious
Prices = Abysmal

Prices are absolutely disproportionate with the quality and quantity. Do not get deceived by the pictures of products they have uploaded. It‚Äôs expected the photographs will make the food look a little better but this place has taken the concept of exaggeration to a whole different level.
Let‚Äôs take the Fish Fry for example, tastes ordinary at best and if you look at its size you would secretly wish that you had instead poked literal holes on your currency notes. All said and done, the one thing I really liked was the Kashundi (Mustard Sauce), its one of the best I have had by far. You will leave the place as hungry as you walked in.",negative

The chilli wine fish and hunan fish were lip smacking!
The fish were well marinated and coated, soft and delicious.
I didn't like the mustard sauce very much though. It had a very strong smell of mustard, almost like raw kasundi. I have had fish in mustard sauce in other restaurants and the taste was very subtle.
Other dishes I have ordered include: Non Veg Combo. Affordable and sufficient for a single person.
The have 4 options to choose from for the side dish: hunan chicken, oyster chicken, schezwan chicken and chilli chicken.
I opted for oyster sauce, the gravy was good. The chicken pieces however were not coated. They were small sliced bits. I didn't like that.

When that was cleared, they informed that the complementary drinks are select, nothing wrong in that but mind you, these select brands belong to a category (or should I write 'class') that they do not have (as that would not look good) in their menu card!!
Leaving apart this experience,may I highlight that the kabab platters tastes bland. The grilled fish steak has nothing unique as compared to the other steaks served around Kolkata.
They even did not serve/ask to serve water!

The partitioned microwave-safe container definitely calls for some brownies points. But the reasonable pricing of INR 109 for this meal was justified by the low quantity of the egg fried rice! For a healthy adult that quantity of rice is pretty low, at least that holds true for me. The Chicken in manchurian sauce somehow made up for the low quantity of rice since this side had four pieces of boneless chicken in it and the gravy was nice and flavourful. Overall a nice experience apart from the quantity part. Would love to try something else from this outlet one more time, and hopefully the feedback will be noted and worked upon.

The Magic Shroom: Mushroom mashed and combined with cheese, pure heavenly taste. The patty was huge enough and the cheddar cheese was added goodness.

Chica Licka: Another one which won my heart, grilled chicken patty, fried eggs, chicken sausage and chicken salami; the fillings are enough to make you understand how good it can be. The in house cheese blend was also palatable. Highly recommended.

The secret sauce and mayonnaise combination was great. The panfried momo was good too. Only thing to complain is that one has to wait for quite sometime for the food to arrive.",positive

Groovy music, flavourful shishas and unlimited booze - all of it sums up to a great time. I dropped here recently and the experience was nothing short of amazing.
From their selection of finest food, Crispy chilli baby corn and hariyali chicken Tikka were superb to start off with. In the mains, the aromatic Kashmiri pulao went really well with the rich and sumptuous currys like Saagwali Mutton and Murgh Irani. Salads and accompaniments of various sorts were great as well.

Chelo kebab was good but could have been better. The chicken stroganoff with buttered rice tasted great. I loved the european dish. But the quantity of rice must be increased I feel.
Next is the murg biriyani with an awesome raita...loved it... really different in taste...the chicken pieces were medium sized and about 8 in quantity.

We visited this place during durga puja, the restaurant doesn't serve buffet during the pujas. So we had to order from the menu.
What we ordered: Mixed fried rice and chicken in stir fried black pepper sauce.
The fried rice tasted delicious. It had prawns, fish, chicken and eggs. The prawn was very soft and almost melted in my mouth. The fish pieces were also good. The fried rice was not oily. It had a lovely aroma and minimum spice. The quantity is not sufficient for two people.
Coming up next, the stir fried chicken in black pepper sauce. This dish had 10 pieces of chicken. Diced and deep fried. Lovely gravy. The black pepper flavour was not very strong yet made it's presence felt. It matched perfectly with the fried rice.
The decor is very soothing. Calm ambience. The staff were also very polite and friendly.

Masala fried idlis were quite good and crispy. Toppings of tomatoes and onions gave it a distinctive taste. Dosas and uttapam came. Potato Stuffing of dosas were not good at all.

We ordered :
1. Pollo Funghi Cilantro(5/5) : Perhaps one of the best pizzas I've had in town, with a generous serving of Chicken, Fungi and a thin crust.
2. Sphagetti Pasta( White Sauce) : Layered with cream and made delicately, the pasta was almost a craft perfected.

Mughlai Paratha (2.5/5) :
---------------------------------------------------
Paratha was delivered in plastic container with rich red potato curry in foil pack. Potato curry tasted very very tangy. Mughlai pieces was big and fully stuffed. But it felt bit soggy and felt like it was fried way before placing the order. Inside stuffing was absolutely dry & hard that made it taste very odd.

Their pricing is pretty cheap, for that compromise done in food quality is totally seen. Still it is good option if you want to get filling food for cheap price.",neutral

1534,"This place is subtle. It has got a simple menu. Hookah is well prepared. Dishes were served fast.
It has got closed and open areas. In the open area, there is a cabana style seating arrangement which will give you your own space. It can accommodate 5 people per cabana. And there's three cabanas and a high table in the centre of the open area.

My review for what we ordered.

Orange Galaangal - well prepared Mojito.
Fusion - Good Mojito with a tinge of strawberry.
French Fries with Cheese - it's just simple fries with cheesy dip. The name is quite deceptive. This is the only dish which disappointed me. The salt content was also quite high.
Pizza - You can choose 4 toppings to make your custom pizza. It was a crispy thin crust pizza.

The price range is similar to other cafes. It also has North Indian options if you want to have the same.

A must visit for everyone.",positive

Faced with a menu with sushi üç£ on it, something I never had, I went ahead and ordered fish, crabü¶Ä, and prawn. While it wasn't lipsmackingly delicious, it was pleasantly different.

Chicken Biryani @ Rs.90 (3/5) :

Biryani was delivered in a paper box little bigger than usual. Biryani was tightly packed & rice seemed of okey quality. It was super rich in colour so was its aroma. A gigantic & soft chicken piece was present along with egg & ofcourse potato that was also very soft. But taste wise it was overwhelmed with its aroma & wasn't really delicious.

Considering their prices complaining much about quality isn't a good idea. However quantity was enough good to fill a hungry tummy.",neutral

The gravy noodles were fine as per my taste buds. But though it was mixed, we missed eggs, however chicken and pork pieces along with prawns (read shrimps) were there. When asked why egg is not there, the waiter mentioned they don't give eggs in the mixed items... I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LOGIC!!

Tandoori chicken-Too bad an experience with the Mughlai dish. The chicken was not rightly marinated with spices, was a little dry and the most disappointing part being that it came with no mint chutney. When I asked them for it they gave me a bottle of chilly sauce, too noob for a foodie. The quantity was not good as well.

When the restaurant personnel came himself to deliver, he made me go all the way to our housing gate, and refused to make a doorstep delivery. I had paid by Paytm upfront, so I had to sort of put up with it.

Finally, they decided to send less portion of paneer , and instead of 8 pieces, they gave 6.

1. Special Chow Mein Gravy: The Cantonese noodles were non-sticky and not over-boiled. The gravy was plain, simple, and full of flavours. There were plenty of vegetables in the dish apart from prawn, chicken and egg.
2. Clay Pot Prawn/ Mandarin style: This was the perfect accompaniment for the noodles. The sweet and tangy flavour of the Mandarin sauce was delicious. The prawns were big and juicy. The prawn did not lose its flavour when prepared in the sauce. Each bite was mouth-watering. 

A toothsome treat indeed. We enjoyed our lunch treat at Nu Wan Li, even though the price is a little on the higher side. The staff are very courteous and the service is prompt.

Talking about the ambience and atmosphere it was not at all good as the crowd was cheap. Seating arrangements were not proper too small place. Food was average as we took a farm house pizza and cold coffee with ice cream. Hookah was good but only for a hookah you can not afford a place with cheap crowd and small space. Even though the price of hookah was same as other hookah parlours. If you are having a group of male friends you can go there but not with ladies. This place needs much improvement in the interiors and seating arrangements.",negative

Coming to the food, we ordered Stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Aglio Olio Pasta, Triple Treasure and Chilli Paneer.

The tandoori aloo was stuffed with rich cottage cheese(chhena) and dry fruits. They were made to perfection and were delectable.

Aglio olio pasta too was good and there was consistency in the taste and texture.

Triple Treasure was exotic vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, baby corns and mushrooms saut√©ed in a mildly spicy gravy. It was okayish. Mushrooms spoiled the dish to an extent.

Chilli Paneer was crispy, spicy and scrumptious. Although almost full we couldn't leave even a single piece of it.

As per the portion I must say that is not quite good, I guess I have ordered Combo so that they have given a less quantity. But if I review it for the taste of food it's really wonderful, and I fall in love with the Chicken Chanp, thank you chef for that lovely dish. I have recommended it to my colleagues too.

2. Gajar Ka Halwa with Rabri- It has to be the worst Gajar Ka Halwa I've ever had üòì. Firstly, there was no rabri at all. It was just like having shredded carrot with milk.

146,"Whenever I goto my hometown I don't forget to go there to have a nice chicken biryani. This restaurant is very famous for their biryani. You will always find this place full of people. Because of small place inside of this restaurant, people prefer to parcel it. Even for parcel you have to stand in a long queue. Now talking about the biriyani- it's very rich and spicy but very tasty. They give only one piece of mutton / chicken in one packet of biriyani. If you take special biriyani then you will get 2 pieces of meat, and obviously Kolkata style biriyani can not be completed without a big spicy aromatic aloo.
Overall value for money and good deal for money.",positive

2943,"Always been my favourite place since school days. Back then I tried many food items here usually for evening hangouts and parties. Now they have started up with new menus which are worth trying. I visited this place last month and tried Wings of Foodpath, Lucknowi Keema Chawal and Chelo Kabab. The wings of footpath is really tasty and the chicken wings are fried and well tossed in sweet and spicy sauce sprinkled with green onion. The chelo kabab is also very nice but the kebabs can be improved. The best is the Lucknowi keema chawal. This is one of my favorite Indian bowl. Not so fond of mutton but this bowl consisting of butter tossed masala rice along with minced mutton curry and poached egg on top is a lip smacking combination indeed üòã
The price is totally perfect with the quality and quantity they provide.",positive

Ambience - good.

Staffs - well behaved.

This restro focus on mughlai items. Not much of varierty they serve . We ordered special chicken biryani , masala papad, blue lagoon , firni and kebabs.

1.Kebabs - soft and tender. Chicken was juicy . (4/5)

2. Masala papads - nothing much as usual .

4. Blue lagoon - very good was not having much expection as most of the restro dnt serve good mojitos. (4/5)

5. Firni - ok. Could have been better . Firni was thick . (2/5)

6. Chicken biryani - enough for 2 people. Now here different person will have different point of views. Biryani here was good ,not too much of masala and scent. Many could find it good many will not. (3.5/5)

Coming to the dahi bhalle.. it was absolutely disgusting!! I don't know it had this weird smell and taste that i couldn't even eat, it made me feel like vomiting! I had to throw that away, total waste of Rs. 50!!(including packaging charges)
2nd Order: Kadhi Chawal. It was good.",neutral
7326,"Blu is one of the restaurants if the Auris Hotel at Theatre Road. One of the pretty posh areas of Kolkata and the interiors reflect that nicely. The plush blue chairs are the best part about the decor according to me. I was there for lunch on Friday. Food and presentation are quite good. The hospitality of the staff is good too. I had the following:-
Khowsuey- Pretty good! The condiments were spot on.
Baldamic Garlic Grilled Mushrooms- nicely grilled
Five Spice Chilli Fish- üëç
Papaya Salad
Thai Red Chicken Curry and Veg Green Curry with Sticky Rice
Pad Thai Noodles
Mango Sticky Rice

11170,"A regular dinner from this pocket friendly dhaba near bijan setu Kasba proved to be decent. As the day called for a vegetarian affair we zeroed in some regular and irregular paneer delicacies, a mushroom tikka along with 2 packets of veg fried rice and 2 masala kulcha.
The paneer lababdar is thing to behold with the spice, texture and everything going well. The Dhaba 24 special is a mattar paneer dish heavy on spices. Not that good not that bad either.
Coming to the chilly paneer - it's a little of base with the paneer not going well with the gravy. The gravy tastes good but it needs to be a bit thicker.
The veg fried rice is on point. The mushroom tikka is good both in terms of flavour and quantity.
The kulcha isn't right. It basically was a paneer stuffed parantha which isn't worthwhile.
All this was enough to tame the hunger of 3 hungry souls and 1 not so hungry soul within a budget of 800.
It's good alternative for regular when you're tired of cooking and need a relief.

11221,"I am a patron of the Parsi cusine which happens to be very obscure in Calcutta. This is the only place in Calcutta that dishes up quintessential Parsi delicacies, considering the other caterer fails at maintaining authenticity & quality. I have been religiously having the Dhansaak for lunch on Sundays, since the last couple of years during my stay in Bombay and Poona. After moving back to Calcutta, this place manages to salvage me from withdrawal symptoms.

Their Mutton Dhansaak paired with Browned rice, topped with caramelised onions and the Lagan Nu Custard (a baked custard based dessert from the kitchens of Bawa Weddings), make for a sinful meal that's got me enslaved. Mrs. Meher Hansotia and her husband Dara Hansotia are always at their hospitality best. This makes for an unparalleled culinary experience inside an exquisite Parsi Dharamshala that's over a century old.

The dish was a tad salty for my palette but the momos had sumptuous and tasty fillings and the pan sauce had a punch regarding its heat.

4916,"Initially I was skeptical about this place. Massive restaurant with a DJ and a dance floor, buffet area and an elongated bar. The design is more of Chinese oriented, with lanterns and paintings hung across the place.¬†
Thanks to the Chef Rohit, the evening turned out to be amazing. We had a few amazing dishes, based on his recommendations.¬†
We tried the Corn and Spinach Spring Rolls, which were perfect in taste. The outer layer of the spring rolls were very crispy. The Baby corn was superb too. Not soggy as it is usually found in many restaurants. The best dish was the Paneer Tikka which came out on a sizzling plate. The taste was really nice.¬†
For the main course I had the Burnt Garlic Fried Rice. With the right amount of garlic, the combination was amazing. The portion sizes are good enough if there are a couple of people on the table. They have a full bar available too.¬†
Service is prompt and active. The lighting could be improved as it gets very dim.

They have over 50 flavours of ice cream and my personal favourites are the red velvet one and the black current one. Their live ice creams are a hit too, we had our live ice-cream in orea flavour and we'll certainly be visiting their store again soon. They also have some amazing flavours for takeaway that we'd love to try the next time that we visit.

But the starters are good to taste. Green Chili Chicken was superb, fish finger was so so, fish taste could have been better but the Cajun spicy chicken was spicy and different in taste. I clearly recommend green chili chicken and Cajun spiced chicken. The grilled chicken with pepper sauce was not at all upto the mark, mashed potato was sweet in taste, chicken steak was hard to chew and the sauce also not good enough to make you please.

Most of the beer was not available as a form of tower on tuborg and kingfisher.

High mid range pub good food, mid range liquor, but they definitely need to improve in music to catch the mood of the crowd.

Definitely I will visit again.

Creme Cabana is located near the Elgin road petrol pump. This cafe have quikry ambience, little Serene fairytale types. A very nice place for people who seeks alone time or time to have a real conversation then just talk.
The frames on wall can be purchased too. They books and games to spend real good time.
Let's come to food.
Food is a little expensive here then other places and not the worth the value. Only I item I liked here was Belgian waffle topped with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. We ordered fries which had a little extra salt to taste which was not good. They fresh lime didn't taste like fresh lime at all. I hope for the betterment of the food quality and quantity too, as the quantity is very little to fill.
Surely visiting again. You should visit too.

5192,A decent neighbourhood joint. I loved the chicken wontons and Thai chicken. These are the things which drew me here. But as time flies and things age the quality of food dropped and price became higher and higher. Keeping in mind the decor and level of service the restaurant seems to overshoot their prices. The food quality is poor of late and I have stoped ordering as well gradually. Good for a first try. A second try maybe not. Keep ur money safe with u,negative

The base of the pizza was just Yuck, so bad, the pizza sauce had no taste, and the Cheese quality was just simply sad. I don't even get, how someone can suck up making a pizza in so many levels, kudos for that!

We had bruschetta which was very good, turkish borek (which is one of their popular dish) , forest pizza, green pasta, hariyali tikka masala, tetrazzini and hot and sweet ceispy noodles. All the starters were very good in taste. Among the desserts sizzling brownie with ice cream was my favourite. Even their main course was quite satisfying. Would surely recommend this place.",positive

The place is well decorated with an aesthetic touch to the decoration and lighting. The waiters were courteous enough and welcomed us well. The place wasn't filled up, hence it wasn't a difficulty for us to be seated.

Talking about the food, I must appreciate the quality of food. In the appetizers, we had Chicken in Dry Red Chilli and Sliced Fish in Hoisin Sauce. In the main course, we had Diced Chicken with Peppers & Onion and Hongkong Lamb with Mixed Butter Garlic Fried Rice. Every item was perfectly cooked, soft and delicious. The spices blended well and tasted great in the mouth.

In addition to the great service of the staff and the delicious food, you will also find a foosball table. I highly recommend this place for groups or couples alike.",positive

The outlet is pocket-friendly, food items available here are mostly prepared by chefs from the Indismart Hotel. Have noticed few things, firstly the items get out of stock before evening almost so food available here are always very fresh. Secondly the preparations are clean & hygienic, & the best part is they taste really good.

Have tried the brownie chocolate, chicken puff, sausage hot dog from the confectionary point. Now they have added a live counter recently where we tried fried chicken with chips & mayonnaise dip, fish fry with fresh fries & dip. Honestly all the items I tried were great in taste especially the brownie & fish fries & the price is cheaper than most of the places I know of.

It was covered with gravy which consisted of bell peppers, baby corn and broccoli. The noodles were clumped together and not even 'pan fried' as the dish should be.

Good combo thali. It contains Not pulao (but they said it pulao), it is a kind of fried rice. But they put Snake beans instead of beans on it. And habe not cut the carrots properly. They also put some paneer on rice. The quality of rice was fine. 
Aloo dum, which taste too good, it cooked with scrambled paneer and green peas. 
They also provide salad, green chilly chutney, one masala papad and raita.

You cannot tell this thali fully veg, because they serve onion with salad and raita. As we are bengali, we consider onion and garlic as a nonveg item. So if you are looking for pure veg for any elderly member of your family, it is not recommended. Else it is okayish.",neutral

The big letdown were the meat pieces. Tasteless, boiled mutton pieces were served with the rice. Pretty evident that they were made separate and stuffed together in the parcel. Even the meat wasn't cooked through and was unpleasantly chewy, rubbery at times and absolutely tasteless.
Had the meat been there and cooked with the rice in the degh, the experience could have been better.
Not the best impression made, on the first time.
Unfortunately, no pictures to show this time around.
Maybe next time, if I summon enough courage to order. Or Zomato brings some exciting offer, hard to refuse.
Till then, the neighborhood has better options.

2561,"This cafe at Hindustan Park has always been the top pick whenever my friends and I have wanted to hang out in a chilled ambience with good food. The place has a really cosy vibe with vibrant but soothing colours splashed across the room. The staff are very courteous and the food, of course, is great. My picks are-
Traditional Footlong BLT: This one is a wholesome sandwich with generous servings of bacon, onion, tomato, lettuce, cucumber and mayonnaise dressing. It is served with French fries and ketchup. It's my favourite here and I almost always end up ordering the same thing.
Piggy Pizza: The thin crust has bacon, mozzarella and olives on top. It's crunchy and tasty.
Molten lava cake: Well, it's a well of molten chocolate. How can that ever be bad!",positive

Garlic Naan,tandoori with butter was tasty,soft & full of butter on it.Chicken kosha & Dal makhani was super delicious. But I liked the Dal makahni especially. The quantity and the quality of the food was sufficient for 2. Food was hot & delicious. It's a must visit place.Definitely I will be going to this place again",positive
8409,"Worst food along with below average service. I wonder how this place is still open in a place like barrackpore where there is aminia,dada boudi and hayat. We had to wait for more than 1 hour and the food they served was horrible,fried rice being the worst.",negative

* Mint Iced Coffee
* Watermelon Cooler
* Mustard Mayo Chicken Sandwich in Whole Wheat Bread
The drinks were yummy and refreshing. The sandwich came with some plain potato chips and ketchup. I was very filling and tasted good. The service needs to be improved as that is quite slow.",positive

**1. Chicken Nuggets - Nothing unusual. It's just paying extra money for something you have for evening snacks.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2. Chicken Spring Roll: It was really good. It was crunchier outside and juicy inside. A perfect blend of flavours and a balance of spices. It's obviously a much recommended dish..
3. Chicken Pizza: It was good. It might not give a pizza hut or dominos pizza feeling but it was good enough. The pizza had olives, chicken and Bell peppers as toppings. The bread as soft but it would have been better if it was baked properly. Overall.. You can give it a try
The ambience was moderate but the food was good. The prices were reasonable and it's a good place for friends to hang out!! üòÄüòÄüòÄ**

The hand dryer in the wash room was non-functional.

They were serving pujo special thali - there were two non veg thali options in the menu - rs. 629 & rs 829.
We asked for the thaki costing 629 & we were told that a thali is not available.
We had to go for the more expensive one.
Thwe ordered the non veg thali - but the dishes were not satisfactorily warm... The rice was cold.
When we asked for hot rice - they brought not so warm rice & as we said this is not hot enough - they said this is the most they could do.
Hence, we were not happy with this part of service!

But after going there we were informed that they don't burn the tandoor after 3 so have to order everything by 2:30. We could've been informed about it before while booking the seats. But we weren't. Because it was a very important family gathering, we had to order everything just as we entered. We were not allowed enough time to discuss about it.

They just started delivery on zomato.
Burger is very tasty only the mojito was very stale. No fizz in the drink. They should lower the prices a bit i think. I would give 3.5 but no option so giving 4. They should do some discounts i think",positive

Everyone is chattering at their peak volume.
The waiters at the eatery are in a hurry to usher you out.
There is no way you can sit and have a decent conversation.
What we ordered:
1. Kesar badam milkshake- tasted good. They put a scoop of kesar ice cream on top.
2. Dahi phuchka- okayish. Not fabulous.

The sauce was quite tongue tingling, however I expected the fish to be deep fried rather than soft and tender.

There seem to be quite a few litti joints that have come up recently, some quite expensive and serving fancy littis also. This place, Litti Inbox, does both, has tradi3littis as well as fusion and fancy ones. I got them delivered from here and so am commenting in the delivery order. The classic litti that we ordered came accompanied with potato chokha and baigan bharta accompanied with two tangy sauces. The packing was excellent. The thekua was just too good, transporting me to my childhood memories of nibbling at this traditional desi sweet also termed as Indian biscuit or cookie!

                        I simply loved the atmosphere here. It is carved out of the Exit gate of Swabhumi, which used to be a go-to place for having an amazing evening hangout. Right from the entrance, you can feel the liveliness of the place. Neon lights, plush interiors, pipped music and cool, wintery air. What better can you ask for? The bar is well-decked, not with alcohol though. The open space and brilliant interiors give it an ecstatic look and feel. They have an immense seating place. One is on the outside with clear glass top gazebos, some tables here and there. Then there is a lounge on the second floor, totally covered. They are coming up with the rooftop as well, starting 25th December 2018. I personally loved the ‚ÄúI ‚ô• UNO‚Äù setup.

The size of the momos is the first thing I noticed!!It was the size of my palms!!Each Momo had perfect amount of delicious and juicy filling!
The stuffing that was made for the pork momos had the authentic taste intact!! Recommended.
The deep fan fried momos came slathered in a lipsmacking sauce.
Both the momos were accompanied with a bowl of clear soup which was quite bland to be honest.

We were disappointed but since it was during Pujo, it was kind of understandable, so we ordered for Chicken Kabiraji and Mughlai Paratha instead. But what was not acceptable was that they were cutting onions without any sort of functional exhaust or chimney facility and two of my friends had to walk out of the place because their eyes were unbearably burning.

The waiting time is also on the lesser side which is also a good sign. The only drawback is the quantity they serve as there are several places around which serves more than what they serve. This time we ordered Veg Fried Rice along with Hunan Chicken and started with some Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The food was delicious and is perfect to satisfy the quick hunger during office.",neutral

We opted for the buffet for around 14 people. It had a nice ambience and a great seating arrangement for us. Hassle free scheduling for prior booking. As the name suggests it was based on the Zodiac theme.

Initially we were served a combo of ""5 element of nature"" and that was quite unique. Later we had the starter with a complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic). The starters had a wide variety with some preparations which I never had before. Mushroom balls, chilly fish, chicken Tikka are few which I loved the most. Apart from that there was live counter, a wide range of items for the main course and sweet dishes.

Altogether had a great experience however the service is bit slow.",positive

The Pork ribs were amazeeeee balls , super juicy, coated with really good quality brown sauce ! Best I ever had(not exaggerating) Chicken Penne Pasta was creamy and the sauce wasn't overdone , with a good amount of meat !
You may think i won't write about the Coke but i will cause that impressed me too. Don't know about you but most of the time when I order Coke in restaurants (like Subway, KFC etc) it doesn't have a good amount of fizz (almost nil) even after you complain and get a second cup. This place won't let you down like that !

Service was also really good , and they also click a photo of you and give you a hard copy of it you can keep , which i have not seen in any other place : quite interesting !

Staying in hostel and Being very hungry I ordered through zomato from this restaurant as I didn't even have the time to browse through other restaurants. Firstly it was very very very time consuming. The food was being prepared since 1 hour. Unfortunately I had to place calls every 10 mins. Though the delivery boy was good and delivered really fast but unfortunately by the time he reached I had already had Maggie as I wasn't able to control my hunger.

5807,"The growing craze of waffle in the city of joy made me try this new place near Elgin. This small yet well decorated place can accommodate 10-15 people at a time. They were very prompt with their service. The waffles were provided without any delay.
I had Dairy dark waffle over here and it was so chocolaty and so delicious. Golden waffle stuffed with milk chocolate and topped with a big kf dark chocolate. This is a must try here.

The only dissapoinment I have regarding this place is, once I ordered Nutella waffle from this place via zomato and the waffles were delivered soggy and cold. This wasn't expected.

Overall, this place has come up with some great variants of waffle and each and every waffles here are worth a try.",neutral

It had peas, carrots and spring onions. Rice grains were long and was properly cooked. But something was missing as the taste was like normal rice or pulao.

Paper Chicken -

Chicken pcs were big and contained 4 pcs. The gravy was very simple (zero spice and less flavors) which seamed like soup. Chicken was hard which made chewing difficult.

We decided on mocktails and continental from the Pujo menu.
Food: Hawain salad, cheese cherry skewers,whole bbq chicken and a steak.
The salad was great, tasty and high protein. The skewers to prevent the cheese from melting came with ice cover. The bbq chicken came with french fries, veggies, the sauce and rice.The steak with bread butter.
The items were good, sufficient but taste can be modulated at the price.
The mocktails ordered were pina colada, virgin mary and abcos special.

We went there for a team Dinner to try out Japanese cuisine especially some sushi. The indoor AC seating is very less and can accommodate 15 people at max, they have outdoor open air seating as well. Coming to the food, I have tried sushi from a multitude of eateries in Kolkata and none of them could make me actually like the dish however this was a completely different experience. I really liked what they served and the sushi was definitely a winner. The Sticky rice and noodles were lovely as well. All the dishes had an authentic Japanese touch to them and for me it was a new experience and a completely likable one at that. Would love to revisit if I get another chance.",positive

Anyway, we were lucky to get a seat at lunch hour and wasted no time in getting to order. Service was prompt and staff friendly. Food took a tad longer to arrive but we were not complaining once we tasted. Ordered mixed fried rice and chili oyster fish. The rice was loaded with chicken, eggs and prawns which were fresh as they come. Quantities are more than enough for two people. The fish was perfectly cooked, with generous sized pieces in a savoury gravy.

This place's chef has the perfect magic in his hand. On the day of our colleague's bornday celebration we have ordered food from this place for the first time. And pleased with the taste made by them. We were slightly disappointed with service, they have taken a very long time to prepare the foods but after that long waiting we were completely satisfied with the food.

We had ordered:

1. Tandoori Roti - This roti had made with wheat, From my side it was a bit hard but my colleagues said that was good.

2. Dal Makhani - This was awesome, that was thick and fulfilled my expectations.

3. Vegetable Jhalfrezi - This item was also very good. Made with capsicum, pointed guard, and it was loaded with whole kernel corn.

Chicken Biryani from Arfa restaurant surprised me and took me by a huge surprise. Located opposite to Aliah, they are doing one thing way better than them. The biryani was fresh, chicken was sumptuous, potato was well cooked and rice was, well, how biryanis are actually supposed to have. The aroma, color, taste, everything felt so close to perfect.

5300,"Location: Near Webel Bhawan, Sector 5.

I ordered the Egg Double Chicken Cheese Roll. To begin with, I would have definitely liked some more pieces of Chicken in my roll. The top portion had enough big chunks, but as I went downwards, the size kept decreasing and the last 2 bites didn't have any Chicken pieces. Size of the roll is great. Wonderfully oil fried Lachha Paratha used to prepare the roll. Cheese portion could be more generous.

Price, I thought is slightly on the higher side. I paid 101/- for the roll, which I thought should have been priced around 80 bucks.

I tried to pay the amount through card. The person at the counter lied blatantly and said they don't have card option. However unfortunately for him I could locate the card swiping machine and requested him to use it as I wasn't carrying cash on me. He lied again and said that they don't accept card below orders of 300, which I found quite unbelievable. They need to get rid of this reluctance towards card payments.",neutral

The food (mainly chowmein snd chilli chicken) was fantastic both in terms of quantity and quality. Was a pure heaven for college goers like us. I decided to again give it a try after 13-14 years and packed the food on my way home. The quantity is still huge but the taste has degraded a lot. The hakka noodles was very salty and had extremely few chicken pieces - very disappointed. The dry chilli chicken was good though.

Guntur Karam Dosa @ Chennai Xpress II, Sec I - Salt Lake ‚ò∫

Served along with the customary Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and Onion-Tomato Chutney, it was a lavish Dosa filled with a unique concoction of dried coconut chutney and assorted veggies and cooked in dollops of butter (read generous).

Though the stuffing was sans any potato, still it was filling and tasty. It never tasted like that of a Jini Dosa.

The Dosa tasted excellent. You need to eat it to believe it.

The Chutneys were good, but the Sambhar needed a lot of improvement.

One person may find it difficult to finish an entire Dosa.

Coming to the food itself: The appetiser and the entr√©es are innovative and interesting, you might enjoy them if you like vegetarian.
The main course will remind you of a North Indian Dhaba, and if that‚Äôs what you were looking for then you will enjoy it, else you should stay away.

Location wise it wasn't a problem at all
Like if you ask anyone in park St or Camac St everyone knows where the pantaloons building is.
The ambience was classy as well as comfortable
The staffs were pretty friendly and they even gave good suggestions
We were in love with the peri peri fries
Literally had three plates of it
And the garlic bread was good as well

Virgin mojito -found it too sweet
The rest of the drinks looked way more fancy then what it tasted

Tried out their crispy Paper Dosa, Sambhar Vada and Filter Coffee.
The Paper Dosa was crispy throughout till the very end, the Coconut Chutney had a great texture and was more on the drier side. Loved their take on it. The Sambhar had a robust taste to it.
The Sambhar Vada was a let down. The Vada tasted slightly bitter and had a grainy texture.
The Filter Coffee was just the perfect South Indian brew. We ended up having a repeat.
All in all, a nice and laid-back place to indulge in a hearty banter with loved ones and friends.

The starters on offer are pretty innovative and tasty. Really enjoyed the mini pizzas and fried chicken ala Kiev though it wasn't really the dish. Simply fried chicken with a tangy dip anyhow does the trick. The Dal makhni tart was innovate. However the Dal makes the casings soft and kills the fun. Food is decent here. Liked the chicken mughlai dish on offer. Need to work on their fish dishes.they use basa which is a tastless fish basically. needs stronger flavours to tingle the palate.,neutral

:
Ordered Afgani Pomfret and Mutton Rogini, and here are my takes on the both.

While the Afgani Pomfret was good size wise, it needed to be roasted more! It was kinda raw and lacked the correct amount of spices! 
Plus the packing was awful! The fish broke in the event of getting delivered!

Again with the mutton, it tasted nice! Literally nice. But they are giving you 4pieces for just 260/- odd!
Result ? Pathetic pieces! Small and all the fat content. I had just one proper piece with meat, rest 3 had to be dumped because they were nothing but fat!!

We ordered -
‚Ä¢ Egg chicken cheese dosa (4/5)
‚Ä¢ Chocolate dosa (5/5)
Both the dishes tasted unique. But the chocolate dosa is 100% recommended from my side. I would have never believed that the fusion of chocolate and dosa would be so delicious unless I had tried it.

5505,When I was working in shyambazar back in 2015 almost thrice a week me & my colleagues would order biryani both chicken & mutton for lunch from here.As the outlet is very small & congested we would send an office staff to grab food for us. After tasting biryani here for the very first time the first thing that came into my mind was why is this place so underrated!!I am not sure about now but back then i felt they served the finest biryani.Yes I definitely never really preferred to dine in the eatery itself..the reason being I didn't find the sitting area to be that clean.

Flurys has barely disappointed in the past and I doubt will do in the future. Also if you‚Äôre looking for a classic English style breakfast, this place is a good choice as perhaps this was one of the first places to actually start serving that kind of food in the city.

Don't knowing the fact we started eating and couldn't find any chicken there and informed the authority. They accepted their mistake but as we started eating they couldn't change as expected. but in bill they write it as egg noodles only. this part is appreciable.crispy chicken was over fried.chicken in the Side dish was not fresh and over quoted with corn flour. Much improvement is needed the noodles lacked salt as well.",negative
5137,The ambience is extremely shady.. so shady that you can't even view your food or the person you are sitting with. The staff behavior is nonsensical. They don't even serve water. I had ordered chilli chicken and roti both of which were priced more highly than usual. In the restaurant itself they served me chilli fish instead of chicken. I told them about it and all they had to say was no we're not wrong and if we serve you fish it's on your benefit. Who sees benefit when ordering??? It's you and your sole choice what you'd want to eat. How can the restaurant staff dictate that. I was disgusted with their behavior. And don't recommend anyone this place. Utter nonsense. I guess that's why they keep the decor shady that whatever they serve you.. you can't see and can't even recognize. I am extremely dissatisfied. They spoilt my evening.,negative

8925,"My orders after consulting with the Waiter thrice were 1. Chilli Garlic Chicken(repeatedly told the waiter to avoid chillies and make it simple Garlic Chicken) 2. Chicken Fried Rice. 3.Chicken Cheese corn Sandwich.

What i personally feel is they must keep their menu simple and authentic. They serve Continental,Mughlai,Indian,Biryani,Chinese under the same small roof. And to serve the diverse menu,they are not cooking it Authentic.

The fried rice lacked the flavours in it.
And the Garlic Chicken was Chilly Chicken in White Sauce. After repeating thrice to the waiter,they horribly failed to meet the expectations and we had to leave without completing our ordered food. Why add chillies when we had requested repeatedly to avoid it?

I really wish they improve their communication between the waiter and the arrogant Chef.
Sandwich ordered was good though. And interiors are good. Pocket Pinch is decent.

The #Chicken_Tandoori was spicy and creamy and tasted as yummy as it looked. #Naan was tender and #Chilli_Chicken was hot and spicy. The #Chicken_Biriyani beared the perfect traditional taste of Kolkata's Biriyani. However, #Mutton_Roganjosh was not up to the mark in compared to others.

It was not barbecued properly they just added masala over prepared paneer n mushroom and packed without barbecue. Taste was eating raw food.
Decided not to blow up our head and left the food and moved for airport with bad taste . In Kolkata restaurant serves good on tables but pathetic food on delivery , it's every where . I had experience this many times during my vacation.

Cream of Broccoli Soup: Though I am not a fan of Broccoli at all, if you wanna get over your phobia against Broccoli try this soup, it's just YUMMY! 

Tricolour Pasta: Well I loved the concept of bringing three flavours together, but I felt the red sauce portion wasn't up to to the mark, otherwise it was good.

Green Apple Mocktail: Though this mocktail tasted good, the flavour wasn't near green apple at all. 

Overall a great place for cheese lovers and a quick bite to make your taste buds experience some delicious cheese-based dishes at just 800 INR for 2 people pocket pinch.

Or if you are for any work around that area i would suggest you to have some healthy tasty Sandwiches, burgers and shakes from this N.V stores.

I happened to cross that street and as recommended by some friends made up my mind to taste the sandwiches. 
I found it yummy, delicious. They make it in a very proper manner. They have many types of Sandwiches, you can order as per your choice. 
I ordered a Chicken Chesse Sandwiche.

The #kabab was good with the sausage, the salad was not upto the mark, even the carrot pieces were old. The number of elaichi found in the plate of #muttonbiriyani completely demoralized the hunger mood. Might it be a speciality of the restaurant, but it didn't work at all.

Right from the first bite I got extremely excited from what will come next with so many chutneys to mix and match.
The dosa was soft and crisp at the right places, with mysore masala spicy as it gets. It had tastes of multiple levels thanks to its chutneys.

Also, there is no parking space and the outlet is bang on a very busy traffic signal. So ppl are forced to park far far away and walk from there.
Even the staircase within the property scares me coz one needs to carry a tray(s) full of food up and down the stairs and they re steep and winding. Someone is (or already has) bound to drop it all there. Plus this outlet becomes completely non 'disabled-friendly' for the aforementioned reasons.

they have a good quantity of filling and a thin layer of momo skin, which helps in identifying good momos. i havent¬†tasted any of their other dishes yet, i do think zomato¬†should ensure that they list them for online order. cannot wait to try more of their dishes.

2 of my friends and I went for lunch and we had,

1. Satay Kai: I had never tried the combination of peanuts & grilled chicken before, but the flavour that was brought out, words are too little to explain the taste.

2. Kaeng Kae: It is the Thai green lamb curry, which comes with warm steamed rice and such an exotic taste!

Coming to the food, I ordered a chicken sandwich along with a brownie milkshake to start off. I found the milkshake really good as i could feel the brownie being properly grinded and mixed smoothly to give such a fine taste. The sandwich was good, although i felt it was missing something such as a coleslaw on the side or mayo inside the bread ; still was good. I then ordered an Affogato to finish it off. Originally given with a sciop of vanilla ice cream, due to unavailability of Vanilla ice cream, I was given a chocolate scoop which surprisingly tasted better.

Food

The strength of Green Valley in terms of food is definitely their tandoori which go very well with drinks. The tandoori pomfret which is cooked to perfection is the best followed by tandoori chicken and chicken Rashmi kebab. Try these and you will be happy. 

Ambiance and service 

The ambiance is nothing special but the service is fantastic. You also get complimentary chakhna here with drinks.

Inner stuffing is of chocolate mouse, butterscotch crunch, choco chips and sprinkled with a dash of chocolate gold dust.. It is served with melting dark chocolate and believe me it tastes heavenly!

Made in china- I have to admit, everything in platter was just perfect and tasted extremely nice. Must try.

Desert- Choc-o-bloc volcano - this was my Favorite üíì the lava that bursted , the ice cream üíì im not a sweet tooth person, so if I liked it , it is definitely worth it.üíì

Highly recommended.",positive

And that too with a pretty good quantity for two persons. The 'Dijon Chicken Pizza' is also great. Overall a great experience and I yearn to go there again. P.S. There is a real bike kept just outside over which you can sit and click pics.,positive
1256,"‚ÄãWhen it comes to CIT cafe I have such fond memories. This is one place I've been coming since I was a kid. Over the years many things changed, like their interiors and the staff.. but what remains the same is the taste of their food . Their's is one of the best Chinese food served in and around Central Kolkata. Be it the Hot and Sour Chicken Soup, the Pepper Chicken¬† , the Crispy Chilli Babycorn, the Shanghai Chicken or their Noodles. If you have kids with you or people who do not like spicy food, then Lemon Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken is for you! You can always end your meal with a bowl of either Tutti Frutti or Chocolate Sundae. It's always a nice experience to visit CIT Cafe!",positive

Waited for 10mins after that my roll was ready. It did not have double chicken and the roll was full of dalda and the sauce was scattered all over the roll which made it very disgusting to taste. Also the chicken chunks were chewy and not tender. I will never ever visit this place again in my life. The chicken roll costed me whopping 48/- bucks.

574,"Good food but with certain shortcomings. The Daab Chingri was tasty but it seemed the dish consisted of frozen prawn being added to a prepared gravy and putting it inside an used coconut shell. That is NOT how Daab chingri is cooked. It is cooked by putting the prawn and paste inside the coconut and heating the coconut itself in an oven. From a restaurant like Oh Calcutta, (having tasted one) I expected an original Daab Chingri.
The Kasundi Kakra dish tasted good - but though the menu mentions deshelled crabmeat - in actual it comprises of less of crab meat and more of flour batter. I did not found it to be at par with the price.Murgh Malai Tikka was tasty.The Daab Sondesh, Payesh though stole the show.

I've always loved rolls in this area and this particular stall offers some great ones. Apart from it, rest of the items tastes good too. It's completely pocket friendly and two people can fill themselves up in around Rs 250-300 max. They don't have any covered seating arrangements and basically a take away sort of a counter.

Onion masala dosa was pretty good but still felt a bit short to the restaurant's great name.

Stuffed fried idly was indeed very good. Perhaps one of the best I've have had over the years.

Chola Batora gives the homely and familiar taste which one cannot go wrong about.

The 3 cheese sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. It's grilled with butter which not only makes it crispy but you can also smell the butter when you take a bite. The cheese inside tastes great.

The Red Bean Burger tasted quite good too. I'm glad they went for a protein which isn't paneer. The patty is stuffed and it tastes light and good.

I wish they had eggless desserts in the menu. Also, I wish they didn't give chips and instead gave french fries with the sandwiches and burgers.

I like the honesty of the place. They made the ambience in a way other cafes try but fail. They take their time with the pizza but the crust is good, the cheese is generous and the toppings are fresh ( although the pizza is a little small).

It was the Christmas evening with my wife in the busy litted Park Street, and our taste buds called of for food. Not to astonished every eatery house was full. We visited Tung Fong but we were requested to wait for 2 hours, but their staff Mr. Nantu Das could manage the seat within 30 mins. We had Hot Chilly Chicken and Chicken noodles. To our surprise in such a busy day the taste and the quality reamined same. Splendid. However I feel the liquor price is a little on the higher side, rest it was quite good experience.

Each and every dish they served did justice to their brand value and even more. It was a super experience to keep it short.

The food is quite good. We ordered Chicken stew with bread and tea. The chicken used was very fresh and it tasted good. The stew too tasted great and had all the right ingredients in right amount. The tea too tasted great. We had 3 chicken stew with bread and 3 teas which cost us a mere 250 bucks which I suggest is very cheap if you consider the quality of the food.

The kulhadi chai is just amazing! Personally, I would recommend the sweet version because it brings out the taste of the tea and gives you the kick that you expect out of the chai. 

The doodh cola was really good! I hadn't had something of that sort before so my experience trying the drink for the first time was quite enjoyable! :) It's the perfect blend of full cream milk floating comfortably over half a cup of thumbs up/coke.

The service is prompt professional.. The best thing abt them..

The ambience is okayish.. Not much to hype or talk abt it..

Bt the food could have been better..
We ordered a crispy chilli baby corn and a momo platter..
The momo platter consists of 8 pieces of momos.. Out of which 2 of them were veg.

The veg momo was blank.. The chicken momo saved the platter.. It was served with soup which was regular in taste and a dip n chilli oil.. The platter had nothing out of the box that wl make us hit the place again..

Coming to the crispy chilli baby corn.. It was okayish in taste but the quantity ks too less for the price they charged fr it..

Okay for a one time visit..",neutral

The fried momos were oily and not too big but quite generously stuffed with minced carrots, paneer, etc. The garlic panner was tasty and the two paneer pieces were soft and pretty fresh. Trying the Kimchi was the worst decision as it was filled with smelly local cabbage and I almost felt like puking. Besides the kimchi, rest were edible and nice, if not great.

We are used to ordering momos from this place since the price is reasonable and the food is not altogether inedible. We ordered 3 plates of steam momo and waited for one and half hours for the delivery to arrive. After a long wait we decided to call them up and all we get is "" we forgot to process the order"". 
I guess the staff could not care less about the regular customers. There was no hint of regret  in the staff member's voice and no urgency to undo the mistake.

When I first visited the place it was a very small restaurant located in the ground floor of an under construction building but the food they served was great. Now the restaurant occupies both the floors of the same building and still continue to serve great North Indian food. My recommendation from their menu are:

Mutton adrak ke panje, Murg lasuni kebab and Kabuli Nan (a sweet nan with peanuts) which are their signature dishes and must try. Apart from these you can also try the mutton biryani, dal makhani, palak corn/paneer, saag meat and chicken tandoori butter masala.",positive

We had,
Secret Murderer ( Cocktail ) ,
Chelo kebab ,
Grilled chicken sizzler ,
Chicken fried rice ,
Chicken Butter masala ( Spicy )

Each and every dish was fantastic but To be honest, I didn't like their sizzler that much!
May be they should improve their Sizzler!

Otherwise, everything was great!

7920,Well wanted to have food from here for a long time and finally had a chance last week. Ordered mutton omlet for a takeaway. They made the omlet within time and as i requested the packaging was done extremely well. Now coming to the food part:_ quantity and quality wise felt a bit overpriced. Some potato wedges and small garlic bread were provided with the omlet. Ketchup was provided. The dish tasted nice though nothing extraordinary. Could have done with a bit more filling in the omlet. They would do better to improve their taste and quantity. The staffs were very friendly and helpful people too. Anyone can give it a shot for a quick snack. Cheers!,neutral

It was basically a beer batter fried fish instead of the classic fish n chips I love and come to understand from the name.

Coming to food, for starters, we were served fish kobiraji and battered fiah. With fresh water verkiezingen, you can't really go wrong and it were good here also. Gor main course, crab kosha was simply superb. The next recommendation would be pabda bori jhol with plain rice. The hilsa with mustard was fiery enough and fish was really fresh. Dab chingri could've been slightly better and id really prefer mid sized prawn (rather than large ones served here) to soak in more of the flavor. Surprisingly, the vegetarian selection was fantastic. Dhoka r dalna and chharar dalna really stood out.

Tried their Pork fried and veg fried momo. Both were absolutely delicious. Loved em. Apart from momos they also has Noodles/Chowmein, soups, stir friedds, chop suey etc.

The decor is nothing to fancy, but a piece of Old Calcutta interior, with high ceiling and brown tables and chairs. Very nostalgic in a way

The packaging was also good. They sent the food in foil so it was still hot when I received it.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

The pasta was delicious but lacked the right amount of seasoning..but with a little bit of oregano and chilli flakes on top...it was just right.

The steamed momos tasted pretty good, but they dont serve the broth.. that's a let down. The sauce wasn't exactly the Momo sauce, so that too needs some attention because momo sauce needs to be spicier. But however the BB Special Momo which I ordered was great. I ordered it in the Panfried sauce. It was a mixed meat momo consisting of Prawn & Pork. Was delicious! The sauce had a strong hint of dark soya & chilli garlic sauce which made the taste really unique. Quite different from the typical Panfried momos you get anywhere. I liked it.

Normally when a restaurant is giving a discount or an item is on offer we can't expect the quality to be the same as it on full cost. However I was taken aback when my notion was busted with their quality. I ordered a chicken roll via food panda at just ‚Çπ 19 and it was fantastic. Today I ordered a full on meal consisting of lachha paratha , egg kasha and biriyani. The parathas were soft and not at a all chewy. The egg kasha was mind blowing. The biriyani could have been better. However overall my meal was a satisfying one and well worth the price . Food was well packed. Taste was on point and it was served hot.

The chowmein was a disaster. It was salty in taste, no ingredients was there in it like vegetables, only could find few julien of carrots among the whole portion. The taste was flat and I hardly found any egg pieces as it was a egg chowmien. I think they use one egg for 2 or 3 plates of chow. The chilly chicken and two pieces of chicken momo was ok compared to the chowmien however there was hardly any gravy with the chilly chicken. The momo was not warm.

In this section the are above than average.
We have ordered Chicken steak sizzler and Chello Kebab.
Now honestly I haven't expected Peter Cat like Chello Kebab, however the dish was full of taste but the chicken in it was a bit chewy and it seems they were frozen before cooking.

The beef patty soft and succulent, the fries perfectly cooked and the dip perfectly balanced with all kinds of sauce and spices. Hands down one of the best place in Kolkata to satisfy one's crave for good ol' burgers.
The only downside is the location. Tucked in the interior of Kasba one dosen't easily come across the place. Had a talk with the owner and he had told me that they would shift somewhere more easily accessible.

The biryani was okay and not very good.
The reason for this is you get a synthetic biryani flavour that comes from using readymade biryani masala and not authentic spices.

When you are having biryani from a restaurant you do not expect to be served biryani made with readymade masala.Making biryani is complex and once my mom cooked biryani with readymade masala that had an outcome just like the biryani from this place.

Coming to potato piece and chicken,I got an extremely small potato piece but the rest of the packets had decent sized pieces.The chicken pieces were breast meat and largish in size.They were not very tender and not very tough too.The meat was flavourless.

I got the biryani at 70rs and the price is justified at this price point.

4499,"Ordered food from this shop with great expectations but did mistake by not reading the reviews before ordering it.
I can say that one of the worst food I have ever ate from any shop. Disappointed me a lot.
I ordered one Chicken Butter Masala, one Chicken Bharta and One Veg fried rice. Had the fried rice before and liked the quality of rice and all but when I went to have butter masala and bharta it made me really disappointed. I just wasted my money by buying from this place. The taste is absolutely bad. Bharta tasted stale as if it has been cooked in the morning or the day before not at all fresh. Butter Masala competatively better but almost the same taste noting.
I won't suggest anyone to buy food from this place if you're a real food guy. Just the waste of money.",negative

Now coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Schezuan Chicken. It tasted nice both the dishes were simple but nice.
The only thing which I can conclude that it is overpriced. And not 500 for two at all.
It costs just similar to some exclusive Chinese restaurant but compare to their quality and quantity it is behind. So it is not less expensive at all. But food is good so you can go and try once.",neutral

Hardly any types of paan were available ‚Äì other than their signature chocolate paan and hence, we had no option but to go for that one only! This was the regular meetha paan with great stuffing enclosed within a hard chocolate coating - fine on taste. Pro tip would be to eat it when semi-cold, neither room temperature, nor frozen!

We wanted to try out a few kulfis, but sadly, hardly any of them were available and hence, we made a move!

Idli topped with ghee and gunpowder tasted amazing.
Chilli Onion Vada was delectable. Pleasing to the taste buds.
Gun powder paper dosa was cooked to perfection. As thin and as crispy as it can get with the delicious gunpowder filling.
The mixed uttapam looked flawless when it arrived and taste was even better.

Chicken Biriyani: The basic one but their quantity is commendable.

These are the 2 things we literally order 2 times a week.
But there are a few pointers that i mention.
The food served by them is good but it not served hot. Their in house delivery needs a lot of brush up.

Masala Kulcha (4.5/5): Hands down one of the best I have had till date. It had a sumptuous amount of masala filling and tasted downright delicious.
Chicken tikka butter masala (4.5/5): The gravy was lip smacking! Chicken pieces could have been a bit bigger though. Went really well with the kulcha and nun.

Coming to the food:
The Roasted Pork was perfectly cooked with the right fat to meat ratio. But the amount was too little and the taste was a bit on the sweet side and I mostly prefer my pork to be spicy.

The quantity of rice was really good. It was enough for the two of us. And the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good too.

Verdict: Price is reasonable. But the quantity of the Pork Starter was not value for money at all.",neutral

Next I opted for a Chicken stroganoff which remains a popular dish in menus of most restaurants. This was well cooked as well. In the dessert , I had a sweet bliny which are Russian crepes stuffed with sweet cream and fruits which was a bit average .

Pappu special chai is my fav along with masala tea which has typical Indian spices to enhance the flavours.
The old school way of sitting  out in open air makes to remember the golden days at Gautams. A place worth the visit for chai lovers.

749,"Going by the popularity and name, decided to visit this restaurant today. We ordered Chicken reshmi kabab, Mutton Dum biryani, Chicken Dum biryani. Kabab was good. Then came the biryani.My friend was halfway through his plate when he discovered a COCKROACH LEG. They gave lame excuses of it being a feather and took away the plate BEFORE WE COULD EVEN CLICK A PICTURE WITH THE LEG. I SHUDDER to think how many people ate that biryani today. When we called the manager, neither were they sorry nor they refunded. Instead they offered one cheap lime soda as a substitute for that COCKROACH INFECTED BIRYANI. If even after paying full amount I cannot expect good service , then it's better to not visit that restaurant. To those people, carry on with your business of duping innocents.",negative

The offer is pretty great. Till 9PM you have 1+1 happy hours!
That was enough to get us going. However, the food wasn't that great.
We tried cheesy nachos and rosemary chicken. While the nachos we're basic nachos with salsa, the chicken was served with a gravy and mashed potatoes. However, the chicken was a bit undercooked and chewey.
Didn't like it.

It's very rare to see such good and such quick service. The food and drink was just too good and the ambiance was pretty eventful.
I would definitely recommend the Margherita pizza, the veg quesadilla(on Amit's recommendation) and the Jalape√±o pineapple dim sum. The latter is something that you would definitely be intrigued by. All in all an awesome experience.

3870,A very recommended pub in the airport area. The environment and seating is quite spacious and the dimmed lighting adds to the mood. Although I did not find the seating too comfortable. The music had a nice groove. But went a bit loud when the DJ joined in. It was difficult to communicate with the DJ playing. The food was quite appreciable. The quality and quantity based on the pricing will impress. The staffs were quite amicable although a bit less attentive. I feft a lack of staff in case of a full house.

We had Veg Fried Rice and Chicken in Bulgogi sauce. The chicken was extremely flavourful and went well with the rice. It's much recommended! Going by the quality and quantity, the prices are very pocket friendly.

I must say that at 240 rupees the pizza is far better than those of dominos or pizza hut. The crust was soft. Not as much cheese as expected from a margharita pizza but it tasted great.

10298,"Located 4 no. tank island at Salt Lake City. This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. We had ordered for a mutton biriyani, butter naan and Kadai chicken.

The mutton biryani was the worst one out of the three dishes (perhaps the worst biriyani ever had) followed by butter naan. The biriyani was only plain white rice quite dry in nature and with a typical smell of saffron coming out from it and the mutton piece was only a bone. The butter naan was better than the biriyani but worst thing about it was there wasn't any butter on it.

Talking about the service, these people should learn the basics before running a restaurant. The waiters were too much confused with orders and we had to call them multiple times just to change the glasses but that wasn't done till the time we left.

Seriously it was a horrible experience here.",negative

1) Chicken corn club sandwich(4/5): Since club sandwich, it had 3 bread slices, cut into two triangles. The filling of the sandwich was wholesome. It was full of corn and chicken and it was all cheesy. I absolutely loved it. One triangle itself is enough filling. Also , with the sandwiches they gave a lays chips packet, which I found pretty cute.
2) Corn paneer sandwich(4/5): This was also awesome like the other. Had a lot of corn and paneer and was all cheesy.

They come in decent proportions . The taste is of fantastic bengali- chinese. Being a Bengali, I totally find this type of Chinese taste amazing. We had chicken soups, crispy prawn, fried rice, hakka chowmin, chilli chicken and sweet and sour prawn. Fresh lime soda was too good. The desserts were brownie with chocolate sauce and butterscotch ice cream. All the dishes were good. The sweet and sour chicken was fantastic. Crispy prawns were a bit over fried... It could be improved.

The service was mention worthy. The person who served our table was very polite, amicable and had the perfect atitude.

Only minus is the space crunch.. The mazzenine low ceiling floor is a bit crampy. I wish they expand the restaurant to accommodate more people.

First they promised for a 25 min delivery then after 40 min when i called up they ask for 15 min more. I was agree with that but finally they denied my food dellivery. 

Taste of the food never matters if the service is such unprofessional & inconvinient. Zomato should have removed such nonsence vendors who are spoiling Zomato's reputation. 

Thank you.",negative

We tried out the lunch buffet which was not only more pocket-friendly than many other places in Town but also had variety of options, quality food and well-cooked preparations.

There were four items in starter (two veg, two non-veg) and three in dessert - but palatable and delicious that we thoroughly enjoyed. The main course had ample preparations and each one of them was appetizing as well as delectable.

Both the biryani rice and chicken tikkas had had an orangish tint to them unlike the usual yellowish colour of a standard biryani.

The tikkas in the rice had been fresh but felt could have been cooked a wee bit better for a tastier appeal.
Raita had been good but too spicy to be balanced with the flavour of biryani.

Though it cannot be placed among the first class, top-quality biryanis produced by some of the well-known restaurants in the city (like Oudh 1590, Arsalan or even Dum Pukht at ITC Sonar), or some other low-key popular places (Besstoo, Kabuliwala, @49) that serve some really tasty biryanis, the chicken tikka biryani from The Great Biryani Co. had nonetheless been quite appetising and delivered in more than sufficient quantity to whet one's appetite.",positive

Only complaint is about the ambience. The a.c wasn't cooling properly and it's a small place so it was kinda stuffy inside. And it would be better if the food was served quicker but I guess that's not an issue since it was made right then so the food was fresh and hot. That's why a 3 star.

Pros:
1. Packaging was nice. Tandoori was cut into 4 pieces which made it easy to eat.
2. Taste was good enough. It was tender, moist and flavourful.
Cons:
Too much food colour used. It was unnaturally red that led to my fingers and mouth red. It was completely unnecessary.

If no colour used then this would have been one of the best tandoori in town.

It's purely Chinese restaurant with number of sea food to choose from. Crabs to lobsters to prawns to squids. Go for their schezuan crispy prawns. You'll surely order for one more time. It's that good. And of course 'Five Spices Lamb'. It was amazing. Crispy and juicy. Decor is pretty too. With soft chinese music and fans and lamps hung all around.

Tried a dahi vada, which was excellent; with cold curd mixed with tamarind sauce, pudina chatni and with sprinkles of kismis and pomegranate. It‚Äôs too tasty for my tongue. Tried also papri chat. Which was equally good. Papri was fresh and no oily smell- well garnished; though dahi was of normal temperature ( would have been great to have cold curd instead).
But the place is too clumsy and little room for my leg when sitting. Find it difficult to keep your shopping bags.

7457,"A nice place for having vegetarian food. I visited this place a week ago. It is located just near Balwant Singh Dhaba. The interiors are pretty decent and also they have a private dining area too. The service is also good.

Here I tried out some of the dishes. Some were genuinely good but also some needs real improvement.

My recommendations are:

Mocktails :
Fire and Ice - Refreshing with a spicy kick.
Paan Shot - Very unique to it's taste, the paan masala truly enhanced the taste.

Appetizers :
Tandoori Aloo
Crispy Chilli Babycorn

Main Course :
Paneer Shabnam
Kaali Daal
Garlic Naan

Also you can try out the,
Jalepeno n olive naan
Masala kulcha

The seating capacity is descent but then the quality of food and gesture of staffs is what they are really lacking in. The prices are very much reasonable but then once they served me tea in a cup which was the most smallest possible plastic cup that can be found in the market and then charged me 25 bucks for such ridiculing preparation of an ordinary milk tea in that small cup which I felt was not at all worth it.,negative

Orders- We ordered for the following dishes

1. Hot Chocolate

2. Brewed Coffee.¬†

3. Frappuccino Mocha.

Serve- You have to take your¬†own food, so it pretty much depends on how much the crowd is and how difficult it is, to make your food. But honestly, it doesn't take much time 10 minutes (max).¬†

Ambience- It is Good and a cozy place to chill and gossip, and have a dining capacity for 40 people (Approx)

Quality- The quality of the food was good, All the drinks were really good especially the Frappuccinos, except the Brewed coffee, it was very bitter in taste, and we had to end up drinking it forcefully, for the sake of money.¬†

Price- From the price point of view it is a bit on the higher side, to be honest.

Being one of the most popular¬†company around the globe for coffee, it does worth it!!¬†

6207,"This is a pretty new restaurant and I've been hearing about it since a long time. I recently visited this place and I'm very much impressed with the food here. This is a vegetarian paradise.

I tried :

‚Ä¢ Soya Bean Tikka - This is an unique dish where soya chunks are grilled over tandoor. This isn't available anywhere else in Kolkata. The soya bean was very soft and juicy.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Tikka Roll - The soft roomali rotis were stuffed with paneer cubes and veggies. It tasted delicious. I loved the sauce they had used.

‚Ä¢ Special Thali - The special Thali is grand. It includes naan, Pulao, paneer, soya bean, dal Makhani and gulab jamun. The meal was amazing. Each dish tasted good.

‚Ä¢ Veg Tandoori Momos - These were the best veg momos I've ever had. It had such a wonderful flavour. I completely fell in love with it.

Overall, I'm in love with the food here. Be a vegetarian or a non vegetarian, one must try out the food here.

It's a big cafe with 2 storeys, one for dining and the storey above they have turned into a beautiful lounge with a huge screen and few booths even where you can enjoy hookah. Each booth has separate game stations which is really incredible and unique.
Coming to food, we tried a Cheese Omlet and their signature HURRICANE.
The cheese omlet was soft and succulent, served with fried potato mash and boiled tomato. The egg tasted good.
The Hurricane was a tangy drink, served wonderfully as you can see in the picture.

The orders were,

‚ñ™Double decker cheesy chicken taco: A crispy taco filled with layers of cheese along with loads of chicken crumbs and a small amount of veggies. Every bite was cosmic. This is worth trying.

‚ñ™Creamy garlic chicken sandwich: Firstly the amount provided was enough for a snack for two.. The creamy garlic created an essence which is really close to my heart. The amalgamation of such is amazing.

‚ñ™Chicken wings in sechwan sauce: If you like some spicy endeavour for your taste bud, this particular dish is a must try. The four pieces of wings served in hot sechwan sauce will definitely make you want more.

As a vegetarian, I should be a little lenient on rating this one as the core competency would surely be in Non Vegetarian for this one. However, I will try.

AMBIENCE: Really good. Gives a vibe of a family restaurant with yellow lighting all over. You can feel that it's an Awadhi restaurant on entering this one.

FOOD: Ordered a Subz Biryani and Paalak ke Riashte for myself.
Quantity is really good for the price charged. Despite me being glutton, could not finish the whole Biryani. Maybe if I hadn't ordered the curry, I might have.
Coming to Paalak ke Rishte, it's a unique preparation with paneer stuffed in crushed spinach. Quite a different taste accompanied with the red tomato gravy. Can be tried once.
Dessert: Shahi Tukda. A little expensive, but ultimate quality.

- Nibbles Grilled Prawn Skewers (pretty average, can be avoided, was a little dry)
- Crumb fried Chicken Breast filled with Turkey Ham (this one was good, but the chicken could have been juicier).
- Japalpeno Cheese balls (served with tomato salsa - good)
- Desserts Mezzuna Tasting platter with vanilla and panacota. (Cheese cake and mousse was brilliant, but the Panacota and creme brulee lacked the authentic taste).
- Long island iced tea and Budweiser

1 Mutton Masala
2 Tandoori Rotis
1Borani/Ghol

Excellent Mutton Biryani with 2pcs of soft, succulent mutton, one generous sized alu and 1 egg. So ample a helping that would satisfy even a very hungry young soul.

The Mutton Masala had one good sized piece of mutton in thick, rich, if slightly sweetish gravy and the two Tandoori Rotis couldn't have been a better accompaniment. Very satisfying indeed.

Two of us dug into the food to our hearts' content, washing it down with the piquant Ghol. The equally good part were the damages. Only ‚Çπ370 or so, for a hugely satisfying meal for two.",positive

When asked the duty manager, he had no answers.. The food spread at the buffet was cold & there was no proper refill inspite of repeated reminders.

Since I'm a 'no alcohol' person so Starting with mocktails-
I have had A pink paradise mojito and Gentle breeze.

Food -
For food I started with Non veg sliders and was absolutely in love with it.. the chicken slider could have been more spicy but the sauce provided made up for it . 3 sliDers for that price was pretty much affordable.

Next I had two in one pizza which was Chefs special and I have to say I liked notHing about the pizza.. it was not the best pizza I have had. It was like nachos topped with cheese and a little non veg toppings and that's it. Not recommended.

They have such a popularity in our locality that the biriyani they cook only lasts for 1 hour only due to the demand.,positive

131,"Visited this place 2 days back. The place is located between Ballygung Phari and Quest Mall. The ambiance is quite good. They have separate hookah zone and normal dinning place. They also have private dinning area. The stuff here are very friendly and helpful. One of the things I personally didn't like is that you need to have their membership card for having drinks. Maybe the restaurant authority can omit this membership card system. If you don't have a card you need to pay Rs 50 to get one. Leaving out this part, the place is awesome. The taste of the food is good but can be better. On Thursday they offer free shots to ladies of the house. They also have normal happy hours from 1pm to 11pm everyday of the week.
The dishes we tried here were:-
üí• Pan Fried Chilly Fish: 4/5
üí• Crispy Chilly Baby corn: 4/5

Now coming to the decor its a very open cafe with clear roadside view amazing to spend time after a busy day. Now coming to the food we ordered mac and chesse and one smoky chicken sandwich. I would like to say here that they need to work on the smoky flavour of the chicken otherwise the mac and chesse was delicious as it looks. Hope to visit again in near future.,positive

The quality, I'll admit, has gone down markedly in comparison to the early days.
But it's still the only decent go-to option considering the locale. The staffs are friendly and the decor is simple yet elegant.
The quantity of any dish of Have More is to swear by. Even a plate of momo can become your dinner, as it comes with 8 huge pieces and a large bowl of broth.
Tandooris are quite good, though the meat can be a little more tender.
The Chinese side dishes are a disappointment, as all of them taste more or less the same, albeit with minor variations. It's better to stick to all the Indian dishes and just noodles.",positive

Bhetki paturi was average. Now let's come to my favourite food which is daab chingri and it was really awesome. The prawns are so big and tasty. They've cooked it in a very well manner which I liked the most. Rest of the dishes were tremendously awesome. You people should visit this place for an awesome experience.

There's always a host to cater to your needs.The vegatable biryani deserves a special mention amongst all the dishes. Only, the other veg dishes have much room for improvement as per the taste. But then they make it up with their dessert spread. I must say, the desserts offered here are absolutely one of its kind.

2519,"Hidden Gem in Kolkata for greasy Indo-Chinese. Stick to their pork dishes, PORK CHILLIE & PORK in HAMEI SAUCE are a must have. The YAM MEIN is another major highlight, they look like chowmein only but a bit thicker. Also try their steamed YAAM WONTONS. Portions are an absolute value for money. A hearty meal for two would cost 250-300 at max. Just ignore the ambience and enjoy the flavours. Carry cash, cards aren't accepted here.

Direction Tips
Location is a bit inconvenient considering the narrow lanes and bylanes (parking would be a tough job). Metro is the most convenient. Get down at Central and take exit no. 5 (Poddar Court). You would see Maharana Pratap statue as you step out. Cross the statue and take that right and keep walking for 5 mins. Meanwhile do stop by at POU CHONG on the way for their amazing collection of authentic Chinese sauces.

Bon Appetit :)",positive

With the strike through of Pepperez from that region I really expected to have good dishes from their end. But it turns out to be negetive.. even the roadside vada paw uncle make better than them.

I have tried most of their pavs, but only like the cheese one. After getting fed up with their pavs, tried some burger which is expensive than expected. The burger is compact.

I tried a few dishes here and loved all of them :

‚Ä¢ Mac n cheese balls - The balls were crispy outside and were stuffed with oozing cheese inside. Totally loved them.

‚Ä¢ Spinach cigar rolls - The rolls were crispy and were stuffed with spinach, corn and cheese. This was my favourite as the rolls were very well stuffed and the cheese simply melted in my mouth.

‚Ä¢ Shredded chicken sandwich - The sandwich had shredded chicken with lots of cheese. Totally worth it.

‚Ä¢ Nutella cinnamon churros - I fell in love with the churros. They were very well made and were topped with Nutella and ice cream. This was indeed a heavenly dessert.

After quiting my job 2 years ago I went back to visit my ex-colleagues and before heading back I went to have my favorite spinach and corn vada pav with extra cheese.

Had visited only because it was famed to be an old restaurant with quality food. The behaviour of the staff was not cordial. We had ordered naan and panner tikka masala. Taste was way below average. Prices were surprisingly high inspite of the sheer lack of beautiful decor, hospitality and most importantly the quality of food. Given there are roadside places around this area that serve much better quality food at 10 times lesser prices, I shall give this place a pass.

Prices are pretty high. But can be ignored for the taste n quality they provide.

Unfortunately, I missed that same good old taste. We had tandoori roti and mutton rezala. Tandoori roti is still good, fluffy and soft. But the rezala even though was good but misses that old taste for which Sabir‚Äôs was so famous. You can try mutton biriyani, chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kabab and rezala at Sabir‚Äôs. My rating for Sabir‚Äôs will be a 3.5 but as 3.5 rating is no longer supported I will settle with a 4 (the place definitely deserve a rating higher than 3)",positive

I have given this place a solid five solely for the food! I just loved their pork! It is definitely one of the best in this city! It wasn‚Äôt chewy and the fat was well rendered! The quantity of the noodles was enough for two. It was loaded with veggies, chicken, prawns, pork and flavour of course! The ambiance and decor are pretty basic and dated. You will get disappointed if you look for highly modern amenities at this eatery! You have to visit this place solely for their food! Trust me, it will be worth it!

A perfect place to spend with your date. As you enter the restaurant, you find stills from popular hindi and bengali movies. There's also a wall dedicated to costumes and cricket score board from Lagaan movie. The buffet spread is good, they have really good option for vegetarians as well.

( a restaurant of Bon Apetite)

Splendid food and decor is what characterises this restaurant. A host of parathas, lassi s and side dishes to choose from adds to the magic. The decor is very creative and out of the box.

Waiting time is average. The restaurant is not very spacious though. 1 paratha is usually sufficient for 1, although I know a person who can eat 2 parathas frm here, at once.. They make the preparation so rich with cheese nd oil nd all, you cant eat more than 1.. the lozenge they give in the end is a reliever. It will reduce vomiting tendencies if any due to consumption of excessive cheese and helps in digestion. Overall a nice restaurant to go with your friends or spouse.

How to reach: Take a metro to kalighat station, move towards lake mall.. A gentle walk and few turns will take you there.
Google maps will help you. Its within walking distance. Happy eating !",positive
2045,The place is average. Great ambience.. Food was ok.ok. The hospitality was not up to the mark. The cashier and one of the worker harassed. Took us to the bank to verify whether a particular currency is valid or not. This is not the way you treat your guest.. Hope they will understand this and act accordingly.,negative

Ambiance was not good. It's a bar cum restaurant, people came with their kids and few guests were drunk at that time and giving slangs. Waiters were not co operative at all.

Had Basket Chilli Chicken in starters. It was really good. Then I had veg pulao, delhi butter murgh and mutton raara. Veg pulao was horrible,no taste at all. And the butter murgh was without butter. There was no taste of butter. Mutton rarra was full of fat, there was no meat. Not able to understand why they are charging 350 for butter chicken and 400 for mutton raara. It was just a waste of money. Above all they are charging 90 INR for 200ml sprite.

The assorted kebab platters is an amazing offer for two, as you can try at least three varieties of kebabs(fish tikka, chicken tikka and reshmi kebab) at extremely cheap rates.
The Biryani portion is humongous and it can be a waste if you take one plate for each person.
The Mutton Hanglabari is a compulsory try.
It's their signature dish and though it tastes a bit like Mutton Kosha, the grated coriander and the smoked flavour keep it distinguished.

The fish used in the sushi was basa fish. I tasted sushi for the first time here, to my surprise it had a mixture of flavor and i didn't get any raw fishy smell from the sushi.

Quantity wise, I could clearly see them maintaining a standard and at par with any bigger brand out there. 

Pricing is surprisingly on a wee lower side. Easily a difference of 10% from the regular brands. 

Presentation is great and they pulled it out in a record 12-15 mins which is exemplary.

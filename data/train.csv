Service persons are quite prompt and well mannered. The food is a prepared with the right mixture of spices which instantly tickles your taste buds.
Crispy chili octopus was really a right choice to start the journey. Our other dishes were good enough with a slight exception of the ham steak with was a bit light.",positive

7426,I got shell of egg in the egg roll. as a result i could not eat that. egg fried rice was average. but i shall give them zero as they don't give proper attention in cooking.,negative
1669,"Their biryani is oily, with a bit disconcerting hue.From the rice to the potato, you know that things are a bit out of shape. But, its damn cheap and you can grab good offers from delivery apps.",negative
6662,"A decent, pocket friendly place that offers warm, tasty food at dirt cheap rates. Staff behavior is really good to start with. Quantity and quality of food are way better than what you would expect at such price point.
What we had: Butter nun, tandoori roti, butter tandoori roti, chili chicken and palak Paneer.
Butter nun:4/5
Chili chicken:4/5,tasty nevertheless!
Palak paneer:3/5,this one was a tad bit disappointing.
Tandoori roti, butter tandoori roti : 5/5. Perfect, warm and soft.
A place where you can drop by after all the pre pujo shopping spree.",negative

1312,"Haldiram, in the present time, is nothing but a overpriced snacks store. There is nothing that can set them apart from local shops selling puri, samosa, pakodas etc. There is only the clean and subtle decor of the interiors, which according to me doesn't amount to much when all the others factors speak so less of you. I would just hope they would revice their pricing in the near future.",negative

3927,"Located just beside Nagerbazar 202 bus stand, this place is very near to my house and a life saver for me on many occasions. Ordered and visited numerous times. This food joint basically a takeaway though they have sitting arrangement of 5-6 people. Tried almost everything. The chicken and egg hakka chowmin, moghlai paratha, dosa and chicken kasa are my favourites from this small eatery.",negative
3574,"Heard that their chinese is pretty good therefore I landed up here with my hunger pangs. Ambience is average with an open bar.
Ordered:
Mixed noodles-The mixed Hakka was 190/- bucks, well I think that is a bit too much for noodles even though it was having a good quantity of prawn and pork slices. A bit too oily with chunks of big chopped onions.
Tandoori chicken-Too bad an experience with the Mughlai dish. The chicken was not rightly marinated with spices, was a little dry and the most disappointing part being that it came with no mint chutney. When I asked them for it they gave me a bottle of chilly sauce, too noob for a foodie. The quantity was not good as well.
Although alcohol is cheap, this place is not worth 4stars. The staffs are not enough polite with the customers, instead they have some egoistic behaviour. Was really disappointed with my visit.",negative
330,"Went there to have with Bidisha Banerjee on a Wednesday late afternoon. The place seemed quite happening and the ambience was nice as well. However I think the music played there live was not that great. Coming to food n drinks, we ordered
1. Traffic Ultimate Nachos - Decent, have had better versions of nachos with dip
2. Pollo Cremoso - Loved this thin crust pizza and if I am going back to this place this will be one of the reasons.
3. Chipotle Barbeque Prawns - This was nice and very tasty
4. Shots - Funky Monk, lick my peach, kill me quick and kamikaze with flavours(4)and all of them were good.

All in all a nice place to visit with friends especially before 5 PM to get the Happy Hours pricing",positive
8478,"A lovely place for post work get togethers, small parties and celebrations. Food is good, alcohol is genuine and is close to the MRP price and the service is good enough to match up to the price point. The ambience is also neat and clean. I would definitely be back with my bunch!",positive
9641,"I tried Bihari Cuisine first time from Litti Express. Overall experience was amazing. They made fantastic Litti chokha. My recommendation is to try Litti chokha with ghee. I also ordered Chhichhora Pakoda tokri. Chatnis served with Pakoda arre worth of special mention. I would say that Pakoda was just above average by taste. Darbhanga Dahi kabab was delicious. Among dessert items, only 1 was available- Oye makhana. This item was just okayish. If you like kadak chai, then masala tea here is a must try. Must try item here is definitely Litti chokha with ghee. The restaurant is simply but nicely decorated. Staff are polite.",positive
6050,"I visited this place for the first time. For the first time i had a bit difficulty in understanding the menu, but once you patiently go through it, its very good !
Ordered pineapple magic. Drink arrived in a glass bottle, and i loved it in the very first sip.
The crunch of muesli, the fresh pineapples, i didnt realize that a juice could actually substitute a meal which generally comprises of carbs!
I am planning a month of carb detox. I would love to order shakes from here, so that i stay away from carbs ! 
They have games available which the pic shows. I left the place with a big smile. 
Definitely will visit/order again.",positive

10495,Ordered from them via the newly launched swiggy pop menu and they absolutely lived up to their reputation.It was a nicely packed and adequate in quantity for one person combo meal of veg wok tossed noodles and veg shezwan stir fry.The noodles were not too greasy and subtlely spiced.The stir fried vegiees yossed in schezwan sauce was the show stealer though.It had broccoli/capsicum/potato/babycorn and onions and was tossed in a not overtly spicy sauce and had added star anise and dry chilli added to the mix for flavour.The one star i'm deducting or rather am saving for my next tryst with noodle oddles food on my next visit or order from them.,positive

5745,"Has been to this place on soshti afternoon. It was crowded just like expected on Durga puja days. We waited for sometime and were sent to 4th floor. The ambience was pretty average.service was slow, might be due to the puja rush. We ordered chicken chopsuey, mix fried rice, schezwan chicken. Mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken was decent. The gravy with chopsuey was too sweet due to excess ketchup. Chopsuey was disappointing. Might be due to rush and bulk orders.",negative

If you are looking for beat in cheap this is the one of them in this location.",negative

Tbh I prefer margharita pizza always so here I took that as well with double cheese and it tastes better than any others in the city.

10277,"Went there to spend time with friends after college! It's a bit in the interiors of Tangra and for that maybe it's a bit underrated. Ordered Chilli Pork, Chicken Wantons and Chilli Potato. The chilli pork was definitely the stealer. Lean meat tossed in chilli soya gravy! This place serves one of the best pork in the city definitely. The cantons were nice but i felt stuffing could have been more, to me it was more of wanton sheet than the stuffing that came into my mouth. The chilli potato was nice and crispy ! It's definitely one of the best places for pork lovers. So do try their pork dishes. All in all it's a nice place with good ambiance unlike other tangra places. Booze is a bit on the costlier side but that's why the crowd is selective. Would love to recommend this place.",positive
1477,I was here few days back with my friend. It was empty in the afternoon. The staffs were cordial and the ambience is perfect with comfortable sitting.We ordered Hand Tossed Big Chicken pizza along with Green Apple Mojito.

The decor is quirky, graffiti adorned the walls, ambience was classy & some B& W pictures of old calcutta made up a significant portion of the wall decor. In terms of food, we ordered crispy fried baby corn in starters. In main course, we ordered the chef's special sliced pork hong kong &the schzewan prawn fried rice. The rice was tasty, adequate helpings of prawn, coupled with veggies & egg, but the pork side dish turned out to be pretty bland for our taste though the meat was tender & well cooked. The portions were adequate for two. Price is affordable. Overall a good experience. Definitely recommended. Sandip Das",positive

Chicken Bharta â a signature dish from the menu, must try. Goes well with rumali roti ððððð
Chicken Stew â a non-spicy yet tasteful bowl of health. Papaya and the carrot pieces are perfectly cooked. The chicken piece is really soft and tender. Goes well with bread toast ððððð
Chilli Fish ðððð

Coming to the food. The food is excellent, no complains here at all. Eveyone must try their garlic naan.

2. Fish finger: Bhekti fish prepared in careful way so that the tenderness and juicy nature stays intact. Served really hot.

4. Crispy fish: My favorite from all. So much that I still crave for it right now.

We also took opportunity of the drinks section and enjoyed a lot. We had entered around 6.30 pm and got out around 11.30 pm. Staffs were throughout courteous and helping. Music was awesome and the ambiance was amazing to hang out with old friends.

The bite sized litti which are small wheat dumplings stuffed with sattu and then roasted/ grilled over the flame, the charred litti with the smokiness from the fire are served together with the potato chokha , which is basically mashed potatoes with chillies and mustard oil.

Somehow I don't get the taste of cup dust in their tea unlike most other places. Their samosas are decent too and am not a big fan of their nimki. Club kachori sabji also rocks. That's been our breakfast on many days after a game of cricket. 

Only lowdown is parking in the area and that can be really disappointing. Moreover, since it's right on the crossing of theatre road, you have cops standing on your head. So no illegal parking for tea.",negative

Since I'm a 'no alcohol' person so Starting with mocktails-
I have had A pink paradise mojito and Gentle breeze.
I totally loved both of them, pink paradise mojito was more soury than gentle breeze and gentle breeze was sweet soury drink.. both pleasing to taste buds.

Food -
For food I started with Non veg sliders and was absolutely in love with it.. the chicken slider could have been more spicy but the sauce provided made up for it . 3 sliDers for that price was pretty much affordable.

Next I had two in one pizza which was Chefs special and I have to say I liked notHing about the pizza.. it was not the best pizza I have had. It was like nachos topped with cheese and a little non veg toppings and that's it. Not recommended.

Pan Fried Chili Fish - It was really tasty. And quantity was really good. But the actual fish had an excess of batter and all the pieces were stuck together when it arrived. But overall tastewise it was very good. 

Pan fried Chicken Momo - Really good sizes, and a very tasty gravy. But the filling was ""bakwas"". I could find a lot of onion, very little chicken. The filling had a almost no seasoning. The momos had a very thick skin. If the owner is reading this, I would suggest them to reduce the size of the momo, and finely chop the fillings so that they can use a thinner momo skin.

Food is bad to be honest, has no variety or taste. But itâs not the kind of place you go to eat so not much complaints there.

Service is pretty good as you get personal attention. They are prompt in response and has a feel good factor over all.",negative

7701,"Undoubtedly, the premises of ecovista is very closely located to the IT hub and the newly developing Newtown, it has an edge over many others; however I was surprised that itâs a place that will probably do well only during brunch or lunch hours mainly by corporate guests or the likes and dinners are usually not full as also suggested by the staff. On a weekend evening, the place is deserted, in fact in dark if you are new to the place, you wonât be able to locate the restaurant as well. 

Somehow we did manage to get there and it was pin drop silent both in and outside. We were there for an hour and yet no movement. Insanely quiet and secluded it seemed on a Sunday evening. The food was average and service was equally average too. Not a place for family dinner over weekends. Daytime atleast the area in itself is bustling.

I am sure the original restaurant in the Conclave in central Kolkata still works better and rightly so.",negative
3888,"Naariyal Pani goes by its name to provide the authentic South Indian food with a western touch. The ambiance, the theme and the menu sparks the flavours of South India. They begin with their classic chaas(butter milk) that will bowl you over with it's rich taste.

However, some dishes seem overpriced, for instance, 'Jalebi Caviar' that only has three spoons of serving that doesn't match the price. The innovation with some of the other dishes like 'Bubble Dosa' is good and worth appreciating.
'Shotgun Murgan Idly' has less of podi masala and tasted like any ordinary idly. Clearly, it doesn't fit the bill.

Well, according to us, with their present concept, the entire offering and experience could have been better.",negative

Edit 1: Had ordered Chicken Honey Lemon. Along with veg fried rice. The lemon in the honey lemon was so intense that the entire portion tasted bitter. Also, the packing was so bad that the entire gravy was in the plastic. Very bad experience this time. Reducing my rating from 4 to 3.

The fish fry was crispy served with not so good Tartar sauce ,which gives the main essence to it. Mutton keema was good but too much oily. Overall a cheap place to hangout after office in the sector 5 area.And the place is full of office going crowd.",negative

Ordered a sattu paratha, such great amounts of sattu in it, served with achar and raita.
Also tried a aloo pyaz pratha, more then enough for a person, served with butter and raita.

10599,Not a good experience on a rainy day. Had visited this place earlier when it used to serve good food but now quality has degraded drastically.

The delivery boy confirmed my address 10 mins later, on the way. He reached there within the time.

They have so much to offer in lunch buffet, the spread is huge. They have live counters where you can order pasta, spaghetti, chaats and they deliver it to your table. There's always a host to cater to your needs.The vegatable biryani deserves a special mention amongst all the dishes. Only, the other veg dishes have much room for improvement as per the taste. But then they make it up with their dessert spread. I must say, the desserts offered here are absolutely one of its kind. They have got cakes, pastries, pudding, tarts, cheesecakes, mousse; you name it. I seriously feel they should have a seperate buffet for desserts only. ð Next time I visit, it's going to be exclusively for desserts.",positive

The location is right beside the Woodburn Street CCD. It is just a small room on the ground floor done up in pastel pink with Instagram-friendly decor. We ordered the cheesy nachos, some cold coffee and the jalapeno and cheese stuffed chicken poppers. I was very disappointed with the quantity of cheese both in the nachos and in the chicken balls. The coffee was decent. Apparently their pizzas and pastas are loaded with cheese but does one have to be cheese deprived for the starters? Expected better!",negative

The best one was the kebab no doubt- extremely juicy and melt in your mouth. We also loved the Shahi tukda it was very light. We have had biryani as take away plenty of times before, so nothing new to add other than as usual, they maintained their standard of aromatic biryani rice and flavorful mixtures!",positive

However the food was fine. But the server was down so we had a lot of issues trying to pay via credit card. Need to work on that.,negative
5667,"Food is really good the price cant be any better. The only problem if you are dining at this place is that there is no washroom or even a hand wash area available, which was also fine but the person asking you to use fork and spoon is something should not be recommended. Would advise take away rather than dining in. One less star for the same. Otherwise not so bad place.",positive

There is a closed area also which is covered with glass, where a Dj was playing so we opted to sit out on the terrace. The choice of food is a bit limited and inspite of hot coffees and green tea being there on the menu, it was not available.(Would have loved to  have it as I wanted to feel warm). 
Itâs basically a place to have Sheesha, have drinks and chill. Some dishes which we ordered were masala malai toast, pretzel and lotus stems . Food was decent. Ambience is quite appealing.",positive

â¢Mixed Noodles - Average in taste. Good quantity for two people and ample amount of sliced chicken and eggs.

â¢Veg Fried Momo - Disappointed by the taste of momos as well as the chutney. The chutney could have been a little more spicy and the stuffing could have been enhanced.

Sitting beside some of the best restaurants, this place managed to serve old and stinky food which was neither changed nor excluded from the bill. Going by the price, the food is not worth the price to be paid. The staff are nice but in the end, its a restaurant and its the food that should impress, but this place failed to do so.

Ordered food from this place after many years thinking that it has improved itself but it's still the same. It still lacks quality and taste.
Ordered mixed Hakka chowmein and chilli pork.
The chowmein was excessively oily. Tasted okayish.
While, the chilli pork was sheer disappointment. Never ever had pork slices batter fried and tossed in gravy anywhere else! Pork slices are never fried, they are roasted and then added to the sauce/gravy. That's the essence of chilli pork. But this one was nothing like that. In addition, the gravy was super salty and tasteless. Such waste of money!",negative

Right now the bar remains closed from 2300 to 1000hrs but grapevine says it's soon going to be open 24hrs. Hope the facility gets a facelift by then.

Two are enough for 1 person with moderate appetite. Kadai veg was nice. It had paneer, grated carrots and capsicum in it mainly. Generally the dish is spicy. However they customised it for us so ours was moderately spicy. Paneer butter masala was average. It was sweet in taste so I didn't like much. Kadai murgh was fine though I didn't like the chicken pieces which weren't tender. The ambience is nice. This restaurant, unlike others in the same area, is quite spacious so you can easily hang out with your large group. The service is very slow however. They took at least 30-40 minutes to serve.

Pros: Delicious momos, serves pork, pocket friendly.
Cons: Bad decor, moderate service pace.

They serve mainly chinese Cantonese and Schezwan (or Sichuan) dishes, so pork is available here unlike any other chinese joints in Kolkata.

Tried their Pork fried and veg fried momo. Both were absolutely delicious. Loved em. Apart from momos they also has Noodles/Chowmein, soups, stir friedds, chop suey etc.

The decor is nothing to fancy, but a piece of Old Calcutta interior, with high ceiling and brown tables and chairs. Very nostalgic in a way

The service was moderate, the waiters don't attend you often, but just takes the order fast and leaves.

All in all i loved it..and is recently planning to pay them a second visit.

Happy food hunting.. :)",positive

But apart from pizza they also have some amazing drinks, starters and desserts.
We recently went there to try their choco chip cookie sundae. A huge choco chip cookie is served on a sizzling plate with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
This definitely was one of the best desserts I have ever tried.

First of all biriyani was not like biriyani it was something else...any road side stall makes better biriyani which costs around Rs. 80...Then they served us rotten biriyani ( Rs. 200) literally which was smelling bad. The stuffs were arguing with us in a cold manner that they make it today noon around 12.30 pm and we were there around 2 pm.

Now coming to food, the packaging was not definitely great as you can see from the picture. Guys you need to spend a bit for brand recognition. The packaging was like it's from a local streetside shop.

I ordered their special sharmawa chicken sandwich - that tasted good but it's better that you don't order it at home, rather have it in the shop. The warm got lost, and I don't blame on them. The fish butterfly is too oily, and the kasundi was quite bitter in taste. However the mixed haka chowmin was better to tastebud, but it contains only chicken & egg, no prawn with it. It's quite dry and simple tomato sauce would not make a justice to its dryness. I would order a Chinese main course with it.

The scope of improvements are there, and I hope they will!",negative

Next is the murg biriyani with an awesome raita...loved it... really different in taste...the chicken pieces were medium sized and about 8 in quantity.

Among the dishes ordered, Murgh Potli kabab will certainly fill you up very quickly although the stuffed balls of goodies seemed bland to me. The gosht Chapli kabab however on the other end was a bit too loud. As per several food blogs I can say Chapli kababs are supposed to hit you taste buds with unapologetic pleothra of raw spices. But I was expecting better balance overall. We were so filled up after the starter course, that we went for simple butter naan and chicken butter masala. Both of those were amazing.

Staffs are well behaved. And also very quick service is provided by this place.

Not much expensive items will give stomach full food with very little pocket pinch.",positive

6912,"Have been here for lunch with Dipanjan Mondal during duga puja Nabami this year i.e. 18-oct-2018.

The interior - ambience was nice.
The hand dryer in the wash room was non-functional.

They were serving pujo special thali - there were two non veg thali options in the menu - rs. 629 & rs 829.
We asked for the thaki costing 629 & we were told that a thali is not available.
We had to go for the more expensive one.
Thwe ordered the non veg thali - but the dishes were not satisfactorily warm... The rice was cold.
When we asked for hot rice - they brought not so warm rice & as we said this is not hot enough - they said this is the most they could do.
Hence, we were not happy with this part of service!

The only parameter which made me give them 4 starts - is the taste of food & the variety of items in the thali.",positive
8236,"Located on in the basement of Spencer's, they serve really good Chinese food. The service is prompt and the taste is remarkable, however the presentation is not so good. We ordered

Chicken shawarma salad: The quantity served was huge and enough for two people. Amount of chicken was decent. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy. If I hadn't tried this salad, I would have never known vegetables could taste so good!!!!",negative

Though their food quality is good at the rate they serve but their management is very poor nd highly disappointing. Its better to order online or get a take away.,negative

4228,"We ordered Tamaki Sushi through Swiggy. Delivery was speedy. Packaging was good. But it didn't match all the items as shown in Swiggy's photo of the dish under Recommended Section.

As you can see from the photo, there was no hint of smoked Salmon. You can locate the carrot, cucumber, tofu and avocados, but no salmon. The description photo showed eight pieces from Tamaki Sushi roll and two other pieces. We only received the eight Sushi roll pieces with ample amount of soy sauce, wasabi and ginger.

Happy with the preparation, disappointed as it didn't match expectation.",negative

934,"Mitra cafe can be considered less of a cafe and more of a cabin. If you're a non veg lover and are near any outlet of this cafe, do not forget to hop in and enjoy the juicy fish fries. The fish butter fry literally melts in the mouth giving you a feeling of utter satisfaction. Fish kabiraji is definitely their speciality,but you can also try out other dishes on the menu. The place also makes sure that the cost of the dishes doesn't make a hole in the customer's pocket.",positive

2657,"Where to start and stop?! The service, food.. Insanely good! One bite and you can feel even the quality of oil used! Non greasy, easy on stomach food! Astounding part was serving kimchi with crispy fried babycorn. For main course we had pulao, kosha mangsho and kadai paneer and butter naan. Each of them spectacular!
The only drawback for the restaurant is it's location. Situated in a bit interior, far away from the crowds of Rajarhat roads. However, this acted as boon for us since this was the only restaurant where we secured a seat without hassle during durga puja.",positive

2527,"Comparing Eden pavilion to other ITC pavilions and buffet lounges, the quality might not be as high compared to its other counterparts, however is still one of the better buffet options and the second best price value in my opinion in Kolkata.Â 

The best part about their spreads that I personally enjoy the most are the salads and appetizers section as over the last few visits, the main course however has been dissapointing a little with poor choices of curries and the simple lack of exotic dishes to accompany along with the biryani. Over time Eden pavilion I think needs to improve the choices for the main course which would really be a boost for them.Â 

Service and ambiance on the other hand has always been good and comfortable to dine alongside to and hopefully will be for the near future. Definitely recommend any first timers considering to visit. A bit heavy on the pockets though!",positive

We ordered the cafe latte, vanilla cappuccino, regular cappuccino. They served the coffee with yummy cookies. The french fries were delicious with the right amount of salt, which was balanced by the honey mustard dip. The chicken pesto pasta was so creamy and melted in the mouth.

1299,We had went there out of no choice since everything around us was closed. Now when we went there we were made to sit in the restaurant area which was fine by us because we were just hungry and not interested to party . We ordered and the order came sooo late.

And the food was not good also. First and last visit.,negative

Each and every dish is perfectly good. Sweet & sour fish has a flavorful sauce and tasted good but not too good. Fish in oyester sauce was juicy and succulent with an amazing sauce, one of the best I have ever had. This is a must try dish here. They also have a huge variety of good food. Overall, a great experience from Spicy treat. And will be definitely trying it's other menu as well.",positive
3121,Well the experience satisfactory I would say. The aftermath was not so welcoming. Meaning when we had the food it tasted good but after few hours all our family members suffered from acidity . I don't know what was in the food that caused this. The service and food is fantastic when we were in the restaurant but after some time things started to change. The total bill 1691 so you can imagine we had quite a lot . Attaching the bill in the photo section since taking pictures of so many things had not been possible. Some of the members of family said it was due to the excess oil that was in the mixed fried rice .we did not tell the restaurant at that point of time because all was super hungry at that point of time and you all know when you are hungry anything that is before you tastes heaven. Please improve the food quality from next time .,negative
38,Well had been to this place a while back to attend an event. Really loved the banquet space on offer. The open area is a real show stopper. The food is good here. The starters on offer are pretty innovative and tasty. Really enjoyed the mini pizzas and fried chicken ala Kiev though it wasn't really the dish. Simply fried chicken with a tangy dip anyhow does the trick. The Dal makhni tart was innovate. However the Dal makes the casings soft and kills the fun. Food is decent here. Liked the chicken mughlai dish on offer. Need to work on their fish dishes.they use basa which is a tastless fish basically. needs stronger flavours to tingle the palate.,negative
324,"The best place for cheapest and best drinks in Kolkata. During happy hours, the rates of drinks are very pocket friendly. The ambience is good but due to less space, this place is a bit crowdy.
Let's talk about the food now. The food was good, it tasted good. We order barbeque chicken. We specially went there for drinks. Had around 4-5 rounds of drinks. The first round was normal drinks, like Smirnoff, old monk, honey bee etc and the other round was for shots. Among the shots, Kamikaze stole the show. Had a nice experience here, hope to visit there soon, again.",positive
5336,"Ordered Veg chowmien from here. It was not up to the mark. Taste was bland, only black pepper was sprinkled and too less veggies. It seemed it was made very long back and warmed up and packed. Will not order again.

Edit 1: Visted the place with the friend for a quick catch up and ordered Veg schezwan noodles and white sauce pasta along with fresh lime soda and masala cold drink. Schezwan noodles were so spicy that I couldn't eat more than 3 spoons. Surprisingly pasta was really good and creamy. The drinks did not have apt amount of soda and felt more like a flavored water and sugar drink. So again, only recommend pasta, nothing else.",negative

Got a take out of Chicken fried - egg - cheese burger and a chicken wrap. Both were tasty, though the presentation could be improved.

Can't recall how many times I have visited this place. I would recommend the continental dishes over here and not the Indian ones. However, the continental kitchen remains closed during Durga Puja time. The staff are pretty friendly. My personal favorite over here is the Baked Fish. I prefer the one without tomato. The turkey preparations during the Christmas season are also pretty good. The ground floor is for family. If you are with friends, you can opt for the first floor, however the first floor is a bit shabby and the ceiling is pretty low!!! However, this will always be one of my favorite places.",positive

The decor is brilliant, the seats are very comfy and spacious. There is a huge tv set if people love to enjoy food and games together. The service guys were very polite and courteous.

Coming to the food. They will give a complimentary papad and chutney. We had galouti kebab and a chiken kebab for starters. The chicken one was brilliant and you can ask the service guys for the same. In main course we ordered hyderabadi biriyani and keema biriyani. Needless to say, they were 2 tasty. The standout though was chicken rara. Just go for it.

3080,"Visited Golden Dragon on Vijaya Dashami evening on a friend's insistence. Despite having a rating of 3.8 on Zomato, my experience at this place was not satisfactory.

We ordered:
Fresh Lime Soda
Spring Chicken Boneless - 8 medium sized pieces, crunchy outside, but not soft enough inside. Did not like it much.
Mixed Gravy Noodles - Quantity was enough for two, but taste was not upto the mark. I've had much better within the same price range elsewhere. Furthermore, they had given only four pieces of prawns in an entire plate of noodles and those too did not seem to be very fresh.
Chilli Roast Pork - I did not taste this one but the ones who did said that it tasted well.

Ambience was average. The washroom side was not very clean. Service was so-so. Waiters seemed reluctant to serve despite the place being empty.
Overall, even though the place is pocket-friendly, given the ample number of good restaurants in the area, I doubt if I would be ever visiting it again.",negative

I don't know if it was because we were the first (and only) diners at that point of time, but the service was extremely prompt and thoughtful. I forget when I had had a softer, more succulent Tandoori Chicken than this and the Naan, more supple and cushiony. The Bharta too was delicious, but somewhat overshadowed by its awesome companions.

*Everyone who works in the outlet behaves very good,the only negative thing is even a small order will make you wait for 20-25minutes,so if you drop in for a quick bite with no time in hand, think again.
*My favorite one in this outlet are Egg Burger and Potato Burger,both at Rs.30,as they fill up my tummy whenever I am in for a quick bite and don't have enough money to spend, plus it tastes amazing!

Now coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Schezuan Chicken. It tasted nice both the dishes were simple but nice.
The only thing which I can conclude that it is overpriced. And not 500 for two at all.

Veg fried rice is totally ok but the veg manchurian balls are so hard that it cannot be cutted with spoon. The size was also very small. Portion size of both the items is good.

Chicken Hakka Noodles were of thick quality, well mixed with veggies & spices. Bit hot due to use of chopped green chillies. Overall okey to taste.

Chicken Manchurian gravy was thick & saucy. It was full with garlic & spring onion that actually enhanced its flavour. Chicken pieces were bit small but overall it tasted nice.

There isn't much cheap options available for filling chinese food in Avani food court. While this is the only option, their food is quite okey to try & it tastes good too.",negative

9319,"We had booked a table in advance over here but still had to wait for 1.5 hrs to get a seat. The waiters were all flustered and showed lack of training in handling such a large group as ours (we were a group of 26 people). The service in the beginning was pathetic. Water was served in mismatched glasses. Tablespoon was given with soup. Starter plates weren't served to most while one member received a plate with chipped corners. 
But what was recommendable over here is the food. In starters, we had ordered crispy chana n lasagne. Both were excellent items, though i found the tomato in the lasagne a bit too overpowering. 
Naan n kulcha tasted good. Paneer was a disappointment. Daal makhni was great. Methi matar malai tasted bland n most of the people in our group didn't like it. 
Overall a good experience overshadowed by the frustration of waiting excessively in the beginning. May visit again with family.",negative

A really good place to dine with family. We ordered Chinese and everything tasted really good.
Chicken drums of heaven- Delicious
Chicken schezwan fried rice- Again highly recommended.
Barbeque chicken- Was not upto the mark.
Moctails- a bit overpriced but one can try. Was disappointed with Virgin Mary.
Overall a good experience.",positive
2354,"Basically this restaurant is serving authentic bengali food. Ambiance of this restaurant is really awesome and I just felt like I am feeling the vibes of old Calcutta. Also they are very much hygienic. Calcutta pi is a new restaurant which is located at near Jadavpur thana and easy to locate. Let's come to the menu we tried here -

Gondhoraj Ghol
Chanar chop
Fish Fry
Dhokar Dalna
Bhetki Paturi
Daab Chingri
Murgi Daakbanglow
Basanti Pulao
Mutton Kasa
Kheer luchi
Malpua with Kheer

Personally I loved their food . All dishes were tasty and delicious. The fish fry was so big and tasty and had a smooth texture. Gondhoraj ghol had essence of Gondhoraj lebu. Bhetki paturi was average. Now let's come to my favourite food which is daab chingri and it was really awesome. The prawns are so big and tasty. They've cooked it in a very well manner which I liked the most. Rest of the dishes were tremendously awesome. You people should visit this place for an awesome experience.

Now you don't have to go to Nepal or Sikim to taste the authentic flavours of Tibetan - Nepali dishes. In Middleton Row try Tibetan-Nepali Dishes At Blue Poppy thakali the new eatery.

Blue Poppy Thakali is high on Buddhist and Nepali culture. We went there to celibrate one of our friend's birthday.

I think the offer is pretty good for two people finding some leisure time over here.
Nachos were great. We had mango delight and Shirley Temple in mocktails. Shirley Temple was really awesome and quite refreshing with a little tangy and sweet taste. The hookah is decent, I won't say it would be something I would buy without such discounts or offers.
This place is well decorated. But the service is a big turn off as it is really really slow. Had to sit for 40 mins for this!
I would recommend to go there via nearbuy coupon only.",negative

Galauti was mouth melting and i will provide 5 out of 5 for this one. But for the first time i saw boti and pasanda kebab in a semi gravy. It tasted really good with tawa paratha and i think the gravy serves the purpose well. Main course was Shahi mutton biryani and chicken rezala. Both were super light. Rezala gravy was runny, chicken was good. Mutton pieces of biryani was very much succulent and the rice was of long grain and did not contained oil ghee or dalda, it was amazingly light and super healthy. But i will recommend galauti and paratha the most. Will try other items next time and provide review.",positive

The place is very basic with small tables and no frills but focuses on the small menu it has and good food.
I personally am a fan of spicy South Indian food hence maybe a little less stars.

What I ordered:

-Addai Dosa : dosa is wafer thin and hence did not enjoy though taste was good

-Appam : very well made (ð Dish)

- Chicken Kozhi Chicken : I think the spices were definitely lacking.

-Chicken Ghee Roast : well sone dish. The meat came off pretty easy and was tasty as well.

And people were waiting for the next serve for 20 mins for next dish. This was a big let down for my family in front of our guests. There should have been more staff for serving food also the kitchen should have be quick to pass on the dishes so even the one waiter was not sitting idle when people were asking for the next item when they were done eating what was on their plate. Hence these people are unprofessional and it will be dicy to go to this place for anyone. Put your money where there is worth, this place is just not to visit again.

They come in decent proportions . The taste is of fantastic bengali- chinese. Being a Bengali, I totally find this type of Chinese taste amazing. We had chicken soups, crispy prawn, fried rice, hakka chowmin, chilli chicken and sweet and sour prawn. Fresh lime soda was too good. The desserts were brownie with chocolate sauce and butterscotch ice cream. All the dishes were good. The sweet and sour chicken was fantastic. Crispy prawns were a bit over fried... It could be improved.

The service was mention worthy. The person who served our table was very polite, amicable and had the perfect atitude.

Only minus is the space crunch.. The mazzenine low ceiling floor is a bit crampy. I wish they expand the restaurant to accommodate more people.

Starters: Rangoon, Tokwa't Baboy

Masala chhach and fresh lime soda complemented this experience. Mutton keema biriyani was our pick for main course.

I personally loved the book section..and this would be a sound place to enjoy a book over a coffee.

But what this place maintains is their food quality. Though portion size is dropping in recent times, but the quality is still the same. This is their USP.

Today we decided to take Fish Fry & Fish Butter Fry. Though the fish fry portion is small, but the fish was fresh and tasted pretty delicious too. Fish Butter Fry, though a bit oily, tasted excellent. Itâs portion was quite filling. It tasted better than fish fry. Even the sauce tasted delightful.

This place is ideal for takeouts for small cranky seating arrangement. But the plus point is that they make no compromise when it comes to food. Will surely visit here in future for some lip-smacking dishes.",positive

The daal did not have taste. Rice was undercooked , lady finger curry was provided which was almost raw.Â  A sweet was also there which was ok and the best was the chutney which tasted nice although it was highly doubtable as to that was fresh or not. Taking all into consideration , this place needs to improve in terms of their quality, taste and delivery packaging to make it a recommended place unless so, this is not a recommended place.

4615,"Delivery Review:

This place is very near to my house. I did a take away of Biryani from them. There was queue too for the order take aways. Cause this was the evening of Panchami in Durga Puja.

â¢ Order was:
1. Mutton Biryani - As per the taste it was not great. An average type of taste. Rice quality was also not good, the potato was coloured in a high volume. The smell of essence was coming out too much from the Biryani. And the quantity was very much average, can be consumed by a person easily & still that hungry person will need more things to kill the hunger.

Food: 3/5
Value for Money: 3/5",negative

What i liked was that even amongst huge orders that they receive on Fridays, still they were able to deliver on time and the food quality was decent.

Sandwich was average.

4797,"After getting food delivered for couple of times, i assume it's more like indian mughlai style cooking than bengali / bangladeshi style. They have an attractive menu, but don't think their chefs are making proper justice to it. Prominent use of mitha attar in every gravy base items. What they served in the name of fulko luchi, its kind of roadside crispy fried puri. Simple egg curry was more like a red mushy onion gravy. Had high hope but quite disappointed now.",negative
4522,"I went this place last Sunday. This place is near Bhawanipur college, but located a bit inside the street. Talking about the ambience and atmosphere it was not at all good as the crowd was cheap. Seating arrangements were not proper too small place. Food was average as we took a farm house pizza and cold coffee with ice cream. Hookah was good but only for a hookah you can not afford a place with cheap crowd and small space. Even though the price of hookah was same as other hookah parlours. If you are having a group of male friends you can go there but not with ladies. This place needs much improvement in the interiors and seating arrangements.",negative

Coming to the service, the service was reasonably good. Donât expect a hi-fi service. And the price too is reasonably placed.

We ordered the Chicken Butter Masala and a Chicken Biryani. The Chicken Butter Masala was at the next level and the Chicken Biryani was ordinary and quite dry to be honest.

If you want North Indian Food around the Dakshineshwar area, the New Sher-E-Punjab is definitely recommended.",positive

1 Mutton Masala
2 Tandoori Rotis
1Borani/Ghol

Excellent Mutton Biryani with 2pcs of soft, succulent mutton, one generous sized alu and 1 egg. So ample a helping that would satisfy even a very hungry young soul.

The Mutton Masala had one good sized piece of mutton in thick, rich, if slightly sweetish gravy and the two Tandoori Rotis couldn't have been a better accompaniment. Very satisfying indeed.

Two of us dug into the food to our hearts' content, washing it down with the piquant Ghol. The equally good part were the damages. Only â¹370 or so, for a hugely satisfying meal for two.",positive

The service was okay on the basis on a regular day.

1522,"If I donât write about Nafeel, I do my own self an injustice.
My mother introduced me to Kathi rolls in this very place when I was in Class 1. Located bang opposite the Beckbagan tram depot, she used to pick me up from tuition, have a roll at Nafeel along with me, and then we used to board the tram back to Ballygunge.
Nafeel is still the same old understated place and over the years, I have come back to it again and again and again for its beef kathi rolls. A couple of decades have passed, the father has given way to the son, who mans the cash, but the quality and taste of the simple Kolkata kathi roll hasnât changed 1% here. A beef kathi roll and a cup of tea worth all of Rs. 26/ is a kingâs treat for me.  So when I am at airports or in other parts of India and find joints selling Kolkata kathi rolls at Rs. 200-300/, you know why I never have them. Because I know they will never be even remotely close to a Nafeel roll at all of Rs. 20/ even now in 2018.",positive

2. Chicken risotto
3. Chicken Lasagna
4. Pepperoni pizza.
Quantities were value for money and the foods taste quite good actually. What I didn't like was, what they used in pepperoni pizza was more of salami than pepperoni. And another disappointment was in main course they asked us to choose between potato and rice. Whereas the option should be given between bread rolls and rice.

I still have the taste of their California roll lingering in my taste buds. They also have a wide variety of cocktails available. I think their sangria red is one of the best I have tasted in town.

They have over 50 flavours of ice cream and my personal favourites are the red velvet one and the black current one. Their live ice creams are a hit too, we had our live ice-cream in orea flavour and we'll certainly be visiting their store again soon. They also have some amazing flavours for takeaway that we'd love to try the next time that we visit.

The thin crust chicken Pizza was delicious. The starters were nice and yummy. Veg hakka noodles, Kung Pao chicken, Jeera Pulao, mutton pepper masala and a Prawn preparation were great.

Food ordered~
1)Fish and Chips~The crispy fried fish was very soft and tasty.The outer coating was crispy and proper.Two big sized fish fries were served to us with french fries.And the best part is they served us in two seperate plates in equal proportion as we were two of us which made us much more easier to enjoy the fish and chips.
2)Fish Meuniere~The pan-fried fish had the perfect softness and melted in our mouth.The boiled veggies were on point.The tangy flavor of lemon butter sauce was absolutely balanced.

Drinks ordered~
1)Screw Driver~A vodka based cocktail.Loved it.
2)Blenders Pride

In the recently concluded 'ahare bangla' food festival, I also had steamed rice and sorshe ilish from their stall.

It's just that they need to improve on the way the food is packed when being delivered. It got a little messy there.

In main course I had mixed fried rice and Hot Garlic Red Pepper Chicken. Quality wise both are good but quantity wise you can easily share fried rice with ""3"" people.",positive
424,"Visited the place to celebrate a special occasion. We ordered a Bloody Mary and Whiskey Sour and both were great. We had pre decided that we would only stick to dim sums and sushi. We did exactly that. The food was great. We have had amazing dim sums ( Yum yum cha, crystal jade, dim sum bros ) and sushi all across india and given the rating of this place was expecting the dim sums here to be better. They were not. The prawn har gao felt over cooked and the prawn was a bit on the rubbery side 
The pork baos were however exemplary. 
The soft shell crab sushi was not presented well ( if you have a closer look at my pics you can see the imperfections ) and the aioli was a bit too sweet for my palette. The pork ribs were great but again a bit salty for both of us. The theatrics and the taste of dessert ( chocolate ball) was nice. 
One thing that stands out though is the presentation and the service. Recommend for a special occasion visit.",positive

1105,"The place is good with average food priced expensively thatâs what my experience was. Staffs are good, ambiance is good, presentation of food is a plus point, waiting time is okay too cause itâs always empty (talking on experience of visiting there thrice for lunch). Check on timings before going. Donât think of going for lunch if itâs already 3:20-30 the Indian food wouldnât be available.",negative
11089,Given that this place is 5mins from my place and I have had a 100 odd meals from this place maybe am a bit biased.. but I feel this is a decent food joint given the price quality ratio. The kebabs and Indian food are okayish... the Chinese items do need improvement but then they do have an amazing dry chilly chicken. Overall as long as you don't sit there to eat u wnt hate the restaurant..,negative
7570,Located just above the Baghajatin Kamdhenu sweets this  place serves some beautiful chinese preparation. Their chicken thukpa is so flavourful and delicious that we always try this. Their chicken fried rice and chilly chicken are also beautifully prepared. Black chilly chicken is what we Bengali love the most.  Their fried rice is also tasty.,positive
8328,Crispy chicken wrap was awesome..tasty and delicious.but it was delivered cold.it was not hot..I liked it.taste was good.but price high......I also ordered BOGO item i.e.buy one get one free item. The item was little dia burger customized combo which includes Pepsi+fried chicken pieces.it was nice too.,positive

ð¥ Chicken Steak Sizzler: The sizzler was good but not at it's best. 3.5/5

6315,"It's one of those places where biryani is not cheap but satisfying. I visited this place with my friend and we ordered Mutton biryani. Complementary they gave us papad and raita. The raita was good while the papad was okayyy... The biryani overall tasted good but the Aloo was not boiled properly.
Otherwise the ambience was also good.
I would give 3/5.",negative

144,"This has gained iconic status on account of the Biryani. I won't be wrong if I say that Barrackpore today is known for Mangal Pandey, Gandhi Ghat and Dada Boudi Biryani. People travel to this place from far of Kolkata, such is the craze. The seating is limited as is the ambience, but nothing can beat the Biryani. But a word of caution, don't be late for the stuff is in high demand. For a change one can try the afternoon lunch which is equally good.",positive
3395,"Tried Japanese cuisine for the first time and hence went here with a lot of expectations. But was really disappointed! My points will only count for the massive ambience and the staffs' courteous manner. Located at Eco Park, near gate no. 1. Went there at the late evenings, the restaurant was empty. Coming to the food, we ordered -

Starters: Prawn Tempura, Chicken Karaage

Main Course: Tori Yakimeshi, Mixed Yaki Soba, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken in garlic and chili sauce

Mocktails: Virgin Mojito

The food quality and taste was good but it didn't fulfil my expectations. The food was not at all authentic Japanese. Also the pricing is more compared to the food taste and quantity. One suggestion: you guys have a plus point about the ambience, please work on that. Try to enhance the restaurant with authentic Japanese cuisine and demand to be a Japanese restaurant. Not before that!",negative

The speciality is the pizza in a cone as the name suggests but it offers a variety of options like twisted potatoes, wraps,etc.I tried the Garlic pizza cone which contained a lot of jalapenos and bell peppers. I had expected more cheese but it had more of vegetables. But the taste was still very good.
You'll only visit the place if you have a craving for a Cone pizza. Otherwise it doesn't fill your stomach like the flat pizza does.",positive

Me and my friends came up to this place last night just to relax and enjoy and we have been coming here from quiet sometimes.
And what has been awesome about this place is its hookah and food combo, staffs here try to bring out the best and actually me and my friends share some great time here so we tend to visit this place quiet alot.
So last night we were upset as our favourite pasta was out of menu for the day, as the chef was not available. But we tried the veg biryani and veg and chicken hakka noodles and hookah toh tha hið

The Paneer Tikka was wrapped in the rumali roti and served with the mint and garlic chutney combo which was just awesome. We liked it so much that we had an extra one. We also tried Kadhai Paneer and Garlic Naan. Both were up-to the mark however I feel the naan could be more softer and better!!!!!,positive
4225,Have mostly ordered in from this place for some evening snacks. Have had their double cheese chicken roll and cheese chicken mushroom grilled sandwich.

The food we had was average but their Indian cuisine is better than the Chinese at least in the dishes that we had.
The most important plus point of the restaurant is their liquor menu. The prices are really less and doesnât burn a hole in your pocket. And the best part is that they have a 2:1 offer on selected drinks !
They provide a wide selection of complimentary accompaniments with the drinks.
And Bira is also available !
The staff is really courteous and helpful.

Once that resolved we got our place and the drinks coupons. However, again there was a confusion as we were given only two coupons instead of four (we had 2 tickets). That resolved, when we went for the drinks we were not given a proper choice for the drinks. We had to actually listen to other people giving orders and look around for the drinks served to know that sparkling wine was available too. Coming to the food we had ordered a fish steak and non veg kebab platter. The steak was good and so were the fish kebabs. But the chicken kebabs left us wanting something more. They were a bit more chewy than they were supposed to be. The music event was the redeeming factor. We thoroughly enjoyed the songs and the music.

Today I ordered 2 combo meals through online food delivery app. First combo was Chicken Hakka Noodles with 4 pieces Chicken Manchurian and second combo was Chicken Fried Rice and 4 pieces Chilli Chicken. I received this two combos at Rs 166/- within speculated time frame. 
Delivery man was very courtesies and well versed with GPS tracking system. 
I received my food steaming hot. Very satisfied with the stop notch packaging. Every items tasted really awesome. Chowmin was very decent and full of chicken. I loved chilli chicken over manchurian as Manchurian was little sweet whereas chilli chicken was spicy and flavourful. 4 big size chicken pieces were enough to fulfil your hunger issue. 
Food Gossip combos are perfect value for money food. Unexpectedly good combos. Will try again n again. Keep up the good work FOOD GOSSIP TEAM. ð",positive

So I ordered Dragon's breath pizza from the place but what i got was lump of pizza tangling in cheese threads and the tomato sauce was scattered in the box.It was disaster.
I don't know whom to blame cause I felt the restaurant should have warn the delivery guy about the food he is taking.Since it was pizza it should have been carried horizontally but the delivery guy handed it over to me vertically.The box was in a plastic.Moreover the delivery guy should have been also more careful and responsible enough to bring the food as it was.Had to spend a disappointed Sunday evening seeing this picture of the food and specially when its pizza.

Truly the restaurants theme went with the way pizza got delivered only the exception was in GOT its lump of human flesh scattered in blood and here, well i have already mentioned before.I could really feel the ambience of the restaurant sitting at home.I was thrilled seeing the condition of pizza ð­ð­",negative

The sushi platter was not upto my taste but that's a personal choice. The ambience is themed japanese though I would have preferred a complete floor seating section.

Ordered:
* A ghee idli
* A molgapodi dosa that comes with gun powder
* A filter coffee
* A walnut brownie
* A Ferrero rocher brownie.

Loved each of these, except for the fact that the I didn't quite like the gun powder that they make it here. However it's wroth mentioning that they serve 6 varieties of Chutney with all the dishes and they are yum, specially the garlic one.

6814,"So here is this place with an astonishing 2.7 but your whole perception will change once you taste their food. I trusted my gut and Uber eats review rating of 3.8 while ordering. Its really surprising that this place has so little ratings while places like BAR-B-Q who don't know how to basics of customer welfare has a rating of 4.1.

My, order was via Uber eats. They still have the special lunch offer. I ordered CHICKEN BAR B Q & CHILLI CHICKEN.

â¢Chilli chicken:- it comes in 8 pieces. Chicken pieces were super soft they just melted in mouth. In terms of taste it was finger licking good. Only thing was it was spicy which chili chicken isn't supposed to be.

â¢Chicken Bar B Q:- shredded chicken mixed with plenty of sauce, a bit of Chilli. Justified quantity as per price. In terms of taste you won't be disappointed, might look red hot but its not that spicy. A good dish to have with roti apart from rice.",positive

Several times I have visited the place. It has no distinguished outlook than any roadside dhaba. Even the food being served on a paper dish have the appearance of rapidly arranged. Neither any washroom facilities are available till now. Still as the star rating I am giving, the credit goes to the mouth watering taste of the #mutton #biriyani. #Chicken biriyani is also reaching to a high appreciation.

The ambience of this place is okayish, nothing special about it. But the celeing on the first floor ( AC area) is too low, you will have to tilt your head while walking, which is very inconvenient.
The prices for the AC and the non AC areas are different. They charge quite an extra money for it.
Now coming to the food, we ordered-
â¢ Khuska rice - Basically it is the rice of the biriyani without the meat or egg. It just have the potato. This dish was fairly simply, yet filling.
â¢ Tandoori roti - The rotis were soft and nice.
â¢ Chicken kashmiri - This I think was the best thing I tried here, it has one large piece of chicken in a rich gravy, not very spicy or hot. It also had few makhanas or foxnuts.

Very frankly speaking, the only thing I have been impressed with was the dÃ©cor of the place.The dim lights into the restaurant and the designer artefacts hanging from the ceiling created an enchanting prelude but soon the short lived halcyon disappeared.
Neither the starters nor the main course passed the test,one of the many reasons for that disliking was that the foods had gone cold unexpectedly.Well it was a buffet menu,so I was expecting most of the foods to be served hot.In the main course, the rice with corn kernels and veggies was tasteless and the mutton curry was nothing but horrible.So improperly cooked that it seemed that it would take a saw to cut the mutton chunks.The only hope was the dessert section having Gulab Jamun,brownies and Vanilla Ice Cream making up for the rest of the disaster.The red velvet cake was fine.

The restaurant in Kolkata is perhaps the largest Peshawri. We were seated next to a table with around 10 diners...mostly foreigners. They were creating a total ruckus and the floor staff did not warn them for their decibel level...the luxury of being 'white' . Once they left...their table was cleaned, only to drop all the leftovers on the floor. This mess kept on lying there till we protested. The manager said the housekeeping was arriving. Does it need 10 mins for housekeeping to arrive. The service was slack...burnt papad was served and table not cleared. No one come to ask for repeat beverages.

2918,"One of the most famous South Indian Restaurant near Chandni Chowk metro station Kolkata. My mother used to visit this place during her college times. This place serves excellent South Indian food. We went on 8th of July, Sunday for lunch and got waiting no 12. We ordered coriander dosa and Paper Masala Dosa. The food was good. However quality of food can improve. I left my phone on the table after finishing off the meal and was instantly reminded by one of the person working there for the same. Thankyou!

7099,".The hidden gem on the bylanes of Dhakuria is a must visit for cafe lovers.

Situated near Golpark Garia auto stand, this place is very well connected by transport. Basically the ground floor of a building has doubled itself as a cafe and dishes out lip smacking delicacies.

You will see the neon coloured doodles as you enter the place leading you to a cute little eatery.

They have Jute stools locally known as ' Mooda' to sit.
And lots of books to read while you chomp on their delicious food.
Few worth mentioning is their DOUBLE CHEESE OMLETTE, BACON WRAPPED CHICKEN, OREO SHAKE & CHOCOLATE CHAI.. loved it",positive
1044,"They serve delicious biryanis, no doubt about that. Ordered Zaareen Shahi Biryani, it was lip smacking. The biryani came with 1 chicken, 1 potato, 1 egg, 2 meat balls and raita and salad in a nice packaging. Quantity was more than enough for one person. The chicken was less tender otherwise everything else was good.",positive
5809,"Samosa Time has become one of my favorite place in Garia. It's a stall kind of a place run by a very humble gentleman. He fries the samosas in front of you and serves them hot. Previously I never used to like or eat samosas but after visiting this place my perception for samosas has changed.... obviously it's exclusively for this place only because here the samosas are very tasty and each one tastes different from the other and size as well as quantity too are perfect. So I tried their chicken keema, chicken manchurian and malai marke samosas. All of them tasted very good. My favorite has become their malai marke samosa. It's very tasty ..very yummy..a must try for everyone. A completely new experience for me.",positive

They don't know how to make coffee.
They don't know what should be the ideal quantity of the food. We ordered grilled chicken with rice. First of all the price was increased due to pujas, which is still ok, understandable, but the quantity, it was so less that we were shocked, and then the taste was not good at all. There were two pieces of chicken, one had cheese other didn't. We were simply disgusted with the food and the service.",negative

1666,"Ordered for lunch at office. The Rice was good and well made. Just the right flavours.
The big letdown were the meat pieces. Tasteless, boiled mutton pieces were served with the rice. Pretty evident that they were made separate and stuffed together in the parcel. Even the meat wasn't cooked through and was unpleasantly chewy, rubbery at times and absolutely tasteless.
Had the meat been there and cooked with the rice in the degh, the experience could have been better.
Not the best impression made, on the first time.
Unfortunately, no pictures to show this time around.
Maybe next time, if I summon enough courage to order. Or Zomato brings some exciting offer, hard to refuse.
Till then, the neighborhood has better options.

It's quaint and no one disturbs you while you spend a good time in their dimly lit seating area. The cheese masala dosa for rupees 100 tasted good with a good amount of shredded cheese and they serve four types of chutney with sambar which is an absolute delight. Their filter coffee for 30 bucks is a must try if you are aware of how to drink it. It just refreshes your mind. Highly recommended. The amount is reasonable and quantity is good.,positive

Selection of fruits, juices, including Kerela juice ð¥... Dahi and Indian desserts were also on offer. Eggs to order, south India. Selection also were part of the spread. They even had dhaba style chai to help you kick start the day. Honestly speaking, though it is a luxury spa resort but I did not expect so much from the breakfast spread here.

But the rezala even though was good but misses that old taste for which Sabirâs was so famous. You can try mutton biriyani, chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kabab and rezala at Sabirâs. My rating for Sabirâs will be a 3.5 but as 3.5 rating is no longer supported I will settle with a 4 (the place definitely deserve a rating higher than 3)",positive

1. Dahi kebab - made of paneer and dahi. Soft and crunchy.

2. Litti - 2 littis each plate . Can have with ghee or without ghee. (Must try)

Needless to say they were yum to the point we almost overstuffed ourselves.

Got it parceled and while opening the package, the first impression was not at all happening. Instead of white flowery rice with hints of saffron, what we got was brownish rice, evenly coloured. Needless to mention that I was disappointed, however had to change my mind after having the first spoonful. The aroma was subtle. The taste was very different, yet very pleasing. Had the biggest chunk of mutton in a biryani plate, even. I was sceptical if the meat was properly cooked, as the piece was so good.

Coming to the food which surpassed everything negative..... We ordered FISH GOLD COIN (â¹276) and CHICKEN PAKORA (â¹155) in starter. 8 pieces were served in each item which tasted heavenly. In main course we opted for MIXED FRIED RICE (â¹180), CANTONESE CHICKEN (â¹175) and HOT GARLIC FISH (â¹210). Again 8 pieces were served in each side dish. All of them tasted amazing and hot garlic fish was beyond amazing. The quantity they provide is more than enough for two.

2 of my friends and I went for lunch and we had,

1. Satay Kai: I had never tried the combination of peanuts & grilled chicken before, but the flavour that was brought out, words are too little to explain the taste.

2. Kaeng Kae: It is the Thai green lamb curry, which comes with warm steamed rice and such an exotic taste!

Papri was fresh mixed with kabuli chana, raisins, tomato pieces, pudina chatni, fresh curd and garnished with bhujia n pomegranates. The Dahi Vada was equally good n fresh.

I loved the starters. Both Indian and Chinese options were great. Specially liked the Amritsari Fish and Lat Me Kai. Somehow felt the tandoori items are a bit neglected. Chicken Reshmi Kebab was average and not as good as the other items.
Cocktails and beers are bit overly prized.

Staff attitude is a bit obnoxious. They need to understand everyone have their own frustration and it harms the restaurant if you are rude to your customer. I am not a regular and considering the small spat as one off incident. Others may not be that objective.

3182,Opium is my husband's absolute favourite.This is at a prime location in Sector 5 and a perfect hangout place for the office employees.The place is not too fancy and people mainly come here for booze.My husband being an absolute foodie always concentrated on food more than anything else.He always mentioned about mutton patiala which is their one of the signature dish.So when had a chance to visit this place recently we ordered the same along with some other side dishes and both agreed that it has lost its charm what it used to be and what he always described me.,negative
8201,"Had a lot of expectations from this place owing to tremendous recommendations from #Foodzpah. However, I was let down. I ordered one regular chicken Fiesta pizza. When it arrived, I wondered if they have mistakenly served me a veg pizza. I decided to have a re check and after a few seconds I discovered few chicken chunks among the crowd of veggies. The pizza wasn't that bad in taste but nowhere close to Dominos. The crust was soft. But chicken pieces were very less compared to the amount of veggies they had put in. 198 bucks for that ain't justified.",negative

1) Chicken Butter Masala Naan Turnover- The size of the Naan was huge and was filled with shredded portions of Chicken Butter Masala which was itself acting as a side dish . The Naan was quite heavy and did complete justice to our taste buds.
2) Chicken Bharta Naan Turnover- This Naan was filled with portions of Chicken Bharta and the quantity was enough for one. There was no compromise on the taste and made us really happy overall.",positive

We ordered orange juice pork ribs(which is must try), chkn nachos with cheese which was okay okay type. The cheese got frozen in no time due to ac and outside temperature. In cocktails we ordered mad mazer, Russian hot chocolate and hot buttered mania. Last one is complete waste in my view with no taste. So no harm if you don't try it. Otherwise it's a worthy visit.",positive

Thanks to the super efficient service of Zomato,their genial deliveryman delivered the food within half an hour. The egg chicken gravy noodles was nothing short of a disaster. The fried egg pieces were almost non existent and the fried noodles that was given separately had a orange hue(probably due to the use of excessive food colour). The worst part was the gravy, it was tongue burning hot, with peanuts and chicken shreds making up the rest. Never experienced such excessive use of fried cheap quality half burnt peanuts in gravy chowmein. The fish manchurian was somewhat better. The quality of fish was good and the manchurian pieces were somewhat decent in size.I think the restaurant has a lot to do to improve their food quality.Not recommended for those who really enjoy tasty food.",negative

1509,"Recently went for a biriyani along with mutton hanglabari at this place.
The biriyani was one of it's lighter kind. Not like how the quintessential biriyani is supposed to be, rich and spicy. However it was on the okayish side.
Coming to the mutton side dish, though the gravy was pretty good, the mutton pieces majorly consisted of bones with very less flesh to it. That was a really put down to am otherwise okayish meal.",negative

5617,I've been visiting The Shack Lounge quite often now. It is usually quite crowded so we call the owner and make reservation usually. The hookah is usually very good but if we order the mint flavor hookah it burns down due to the coal very quickly. The flavor burns down and it starts chokking us. The food is very good. Especially the combo reduces the price of the hookah and food items. The crowd is quite cheap few days and the ambience is very good. The staffs are quite friendly and well behaved.,positive
1,What more to say about a place that we keep on visiting again and again. It is THE best buffet in town...keep up the good work guys...may your kebabs remain as great as your service,positive
5137,The ambience is extremely shady.. so shady that you can't even view your food or the person you are sitting with. The staff behavior is nonsensical. They don't even serve water. I had ordered chilli chicken and roti both of which were priced more highly than usual. In the restaurant itself they served me chilli fish instead of chicken. I told them about it and all they had to say was no we're not wrong and if we serve you fish it's on your benefit. Who sees benefit when ordering??? It's you and your sole choice what you'd want to eat. How can the restaurant staff dictate that. I was disgusted with their behavior. And don't recommend anyone this place. Utter nonsense. I guess that's why they keep the decor shady that whatever they serve you.. you can't see and can't even recognize. I am extremely dissatisfied. They spoilt my evening.,negative
2485,Itâs no doubt a happening place. It was a âladies nightâ special so my girls and I didnât have to pay the entry fee. The place was packed with youngster. The drinks were on the house but we had to pay for the food. Food tasted average. Pretty sure no one goes to eat but to have a fun time with friends. I must say the dj was awesome that night! Ended up with a sprained leg later that night but thatâs acceptable for good dance music!,negative

The food was good, but there can be improvements. The parsley momos were good. Loved the peanut dip with it. The thai paneer was too strong in taste, though it's a highlight there. Pan-fried noodles were also well prepared.
The servers were earnest and helpful but can be more refined.",positive

9083,"I have ordered and got food delivered from this place several times. I once found pork chunks in my (chicken) noodles instead of pieces of chicken. It didnât bother me much because I am a liberal Bengali, but for those who have religious issues would have had a very bad experience. Moreover, the Chicken Thukpa tasted so bland and empty. I mostly order Mixed Pan Fried Noodles because of its sauce and its quite filling. The Fried Momos tasted like they have been dipped in low quality oil. 

I rated it 3 Stars as they have placed the prices accordingly with the food quality. 

I hope they improve their food standards.",negative

1839,"We have been there last week for team dinner. We have been offered with special corporate package with bottled drinks. They charged around Rs. 700 AI for 2 veg starters, 2 non veg starters. 2 veg main course and 2 non veg main course. Only fish starter was good all other food was very ordinary. They are specialized for chicken wings but that one was too bad. Drink they used to serve with special bottle pricing which is good thing for drinkers. Never go here for only food.

One shocking thing I noticed, we were almost full with drinks and starters so requested them to bring main course with very less quantity. They didnât listen and brought huge quantity. When we said them, we donât want to waste food so take them upfront. They replied, nothing will be wasted, you eat how much you can, will return back remaining food. It is so unhygienic. I will never go to this place again.",negative

Some of my favorites were-

BBQ sticky orange glazed chicken wings (best wings with a little sweet kick )
Grilled fish with lemon butter caper sauce (this was the best grilled fish I have ever tried , a must must try)
Green Thai curry with steamed rice ( I am not very fond of Thai curry as the coconut tastes overpowers it but if u like thai then do try)
Chicken steak with BBQ sauce ( the only prob with this was the quantity)
Bourbon shake
Raspberry herbal tea ( fav)
Hot chocolate",positive

10929,"This outlet is situated in Behala. Ahare Bahare is quite a catchy name. But the food isn't.

This outlet need to improve a lot. I ordered Misty Polau, Egg Chicken Polau & Fish Oly from this outlet. Misty Polau was decent among the all, but when it comes to Egg Chicken Polau they lost the Ghee matter a lot. It was way much dry & Polau dishes suppose not to be that. Coming to the Fish Oly, I think I was cheated. Fish Oly was in main dish & when I recieved it feels like a starter. It was deep oil fry, 4 in piece with a kind of fish which stinks. 

If you guys want to have Bhasa fish & prawns at a competitive price please call 9051345272.

A must try is the honey chicken and the Kim Li Loi special fried rice. If there's one dish you should simply not miss, it's their Chicken Hakka noodles. Tastes better than other restaurants' Hakka noodles.

I heard Kolkata had lots of cabin cafÃ©s but witnessed for the second time again after sabir's. I couldn't find anything interesting to talk about its interior. Staff behaviour was pretty weird. And seats are extremely uncomfortable. We ordered few beers and definitely roasted chilli pork. We also tried some different recipes of pork and fishes. But the roasted pork was the best among all. I am certainly coming up again for more of its pork items. This is truly little shabby but it's a heaven for pork lovers.",negative

2337,"One of the most diabolical dining experiences. As there was a live band performance this evening we went there reserving from Zomato. First, they had no idea regarding the offer that a Zomato gold member supposed to have during the session. They kept us waiting for 3 minutes, followed by a confusion over how many complementary drinks to be served. When that was cleared, they informed that the complementary drinks are select, nothing wrong in that but mind you, these select brands belong to a category (or should I write 'class') that they do not have (as that would not look good) in their menu card!!
Leaving apart this experience,may I highlight that the kabab platters tastes bland. The grilled fish steak has nothing unique as compared to the other steaks served around Kolkata.
They even did not serve/ask to serve water!
Table remained mostly unattended.

Nothing can be more appalling.",negative

What i personally feel is they must keep their menu simple and authentic. They serve Continental,Mughlai,Indian,Biryani,Chinese under the same small roof. And to serve the diverse menu,they are not cooking it Authentic.

The fried rice lacked the flavours in it.
And the Garlic Chicken was Chilly Chicken in White Sauce. After repeating thrice to the waiter,they horribly failed to meet the expectations and we had to leave without completing our ordered food. Why add chillies when we had requested repeatedly to avoid it?

7029,This eatery will never disappoint you if you love the food taste of anything which is available in this restaurant and northern parts of India. I had ordered a non veg thali combo 1 and there were loads of tasty stuff. The chicken tikka was good but not perfect....The chicken kasa was like a chicken curry but did not have the taste as a kasa should be...A papad was provided along with a naan ...Papad was baked and not fried in oil which goes as per my liking and it depends person to person......Onion and carrot Julian's were there marinated in red chilli powder....Dal was good.......The potato sabji had the correct taste and blend to go with everything.....and the best part to top it all up was the gulab jamun....This was extremely tasty......,positive

9684,"Located very near to Lake Mall and beside Charuchandra College...I had no idea there was such a good looking Bengali restaurant here.
I will describe the decor first.
The decor is simply gorgeous. Everything is done with utmost precision. They even have a fountain inside!! Each corner is pouring with elite class bangaliana.
Coming to the food:
I ordered the non veg thali.It consisted of:
Aloo Bhaja- Crispy
Luchi- Two phulko luchi
Cholar Dal- To dunk the phulko luchis
Rice- Basmati Rice
Macher matha die cholar Dal- Perfect quinquennial Bengali home food, perfectly paired with the rice.
Chicken kosha- The pieces were not good.But the taste was good.
Fish kalia- The fish was not well marinated.The gravy could have been better.
Chatni- Typical Bengali mango chutney.yummy.
Rosogolla-Nice.
Papad-well...crunchy.

Overall food Verdict is...the food is pretty mediocre.But the decor and ambience is very pretty.
Quite easy on the pocket. But the service is too slow.

9509,"I was looking to get food delivered. It was quiet late around 10 pm. I found yo yo momo and thought of giving it a try. I ordered one plate of egg chicken haka noodles along with semi-gravy chili chicken. The bill was cheaper than I was expecting. The home delivery service was good. I got the food delivered to my place around 10:40. The food was good and the quantity was good enough to feed 2 people. It was worth my money.
Recently I ordered a cream chicken which was tasty too",positive
8190,"I recently paid a visit to this place and had a exciting experience here. Each and every shakes here have got an unique taste. Being a frequent visitor of this outlet at Sarat Bose Road I loved the way they have brought three different outlet under one roof and provided a lot of space for the customers to relish the food they have. It is very unlike the other drink shops at Kolkata.

Things I had here includes Caramel Popcorn Shake, Strawberry Choco from the section of thick shake. A special mention to the Caramel Popcorn shake. It had a very unique flavour which still lingers on my mouth. I had the Alphonso mango from the fruity shakes and the cold coffee from the classic shakes. Each and every shakes are executed very well and worth a try.

Next time be it a plan for a day out or you're looking for some snacks to munch upon during the evening then this is where you should head to.",positive
9329,"Located near Priya Cinema, Deshpriya Park, this cafe with quirky interiors is a pretty decent place to hangout with friends and family. The hookah section is separate from the casual dining space. The interiors are out of the box and it feels like they overdid it.
Coming to the food, we ordered Stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Aglio Olio Pasta, Triple Treasure and Chilli Paneer.

The tandoori aloo was stuffed with rich cottage cheese(chhena) and dry fruits. They were made to perfection and were delectable.

Aglio olio pasta too was good and there was consistency in the taste and texture.

Triple Treasure was exotic vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, baby corns and mushrooms sautÃ©ed in a mildly spicy gravy. It was okayish. Mushrooms spoiled the dish to an extent.

Chilli Paneer was crispy, spicy and scrumptious. Although almost full we couldn't leave even a single piece of it.
The service and staff was good. A good experience :)",positive

According to the menu, the steak falls under the main course, which is said to be served with bread or rice. But they said that rice wasn't ready, so they served it with mashed potato.

Really liked the biryani.

Serving that quality of biryani, when it quite late of night, holding on to the originating flavours, is a tough task and jabrr afghani is doing that in great fashion.
A bit too oily in my preference but, hey, it tasted well, that's quite the atory anyway.

What I tasted from their outlet?

The fine special noodles and also their egg chicken gravy noodles.

No compromise on it, they offer a lot compared to the pricing.

Taste?
The fine special noodles comprises all the rich features of mushroom, chicken, egg & prawn - perfectly tossed & aggressively priced.
Tastes good enough, so does the gravy chowmein.

Classic & rich flavours.

We ordered their trademark specials - Dajaj Chermoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish. The former was four chicken leg pieces, beautifully charred and very juicy, served with a mayo dip. *Strongly recommended*.
The latter was basically fish fingers with a unique plating. It had a light fried coating due to the beer batter and served in a Budweiser beer can with an orange dip. I didn't really find this starter to be a standout.

For the mains, we ordered Coq-Au-Vain and Shepherd's Pie. Coq-Au-Vain is *strongly recommended*. The chicken pieces were plentiful and succulent and the dish had a rich flavour to it. My only suggestion would be to increase the quantity of the rice served with it.

Service was quick, and the ambience pleasant. Our bill came up to Rs 1281.",positive

Prawn was fresh and fried to perfection. Next came the main dishes e.g. Spicy Coriander Rice , Butter noodles and Kung Pau chicken. Spicy Coriander rice is the signature dish and a must try. The smell of fresh coriander coming out of moderately spicy rice was mouthwatering.   I have not had such a nice fried rice in recent times. Kung Pau chicken was soft and juicy. Butter noodles melted inside mouth. The amount of prawn and chicken in the mixed noodles was generous. We had Darshan ( Chinese Wonton Strips ) as desert.

10160,"Cake Mixing Ceremony at The Stadel.!

Cheer up for Christmas, as Stadel brings in to you some of the lovely cakes which got kicked off with a beautiful cake mixing ceremony a couple of days ago. A moment of joy, frolic and happiness, this is one occasion where everyone gathers in, and helps out by pouring in liquor and juices on top of a huge assortment of nuts and dry fruits.

The entire atmosphere gets filled in with the aroma of the liquor and creates almost a mesmerized effect and trance upon those present. Swirl, twist and carefully ripple through your hands within the mixture and combine them as many times as you can for the liquid to be really soaked inside as deeply and finely as possible!

This mixture will then be stored under appropriate conditions, wherein it would get fermented to produce some lovely outputs before Christmas and New Year kicks in!

Ambience was good and had enough space and also had wifi..
We decided to have quick dinner for here .. first of all already they had festive menu for that day. regular menu is not served . We took 1plt mix noodles 1plt mix fried rice and 1plt oyster sauce chicken ..
Service speed was very very poor .. only we were the customer for that time and they took almost 50mintues to served ..
As per their price food quality and quantity was so poor .. almost taste like road side shop .. noodles was little bit good but fried rice was very poor , hard ..
Oyster chicken was good and had 6pc chicken ..
Our bill was 605

Chowpatty Chatpata- named after the famous Chowpatty beach in Mumbai. The fries tasted good and served in cute mini toy truck which is really an eye catcher.

Oreo Pakoda - this was something unusual which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top. I tasted for the first time and it tasted amazing.

Mint Alepino- fries mixed with tangy mint jalapeÃ±o sauce. The fries were fresh and crispy too.

Paan Shake- the taste was okay, the flavours were also right, the shake could have been better if the consistency was thick.

We stopped by the nearest stop possible and found out this All vegetarian Restaurant in Bara Bazar.

We ordered three things in our thaali.

Butter Naan- Soft and tasty, had balanced amount of jeera that contributed to the taste. Liked it, but it ain't the best naan of my life.
Palak paneer- Creamy and delicious. Had abundant amount of paneer in it, moderately spicy and it did melt in my mouth. I did customize it with the lemon ,salt and chilli provided along with the dish, because I love spicy foods. I highly recommend it.

Bundi Raita- Again creamy and delicious, bundi was crunchy . It was a little less salty but I used the salt provided according to my taste preferences. I loved this too.

Quantity is adequate for the price and is rather value for money.
Now coming to taste, the Reshmi kebab was a big let down. The pieces were stiff, over cooked and the spices not properly infused. But the Tangri kebab was shockingly wonderful. The biriyani was also good but a bit oily for some people's liking.
I hope they will improve upon the areas they are lacking in. N.B- 4 stars are only for the Tangri kebab and biriyani.",positive

Sammy, our waiter almost was like a family member and looked after us constantly be it changing plates or replacing a fork we had dropped on the floor.
Place was packed today, being Pujo but the staff were well numbered and looked after other tables impeccably.
We had so much tasty and well seasoned food with authentic spices and ghee and oil being used in the correct amount, one could taste the flavour of each dish even after eating spoonfuls.
The view of Ganga flowing by as we ate added to the charm of the food and the ambience which in this case is unmatched in all Kolkata and/or throughout India.

The only drawback is that there is no proper sitting area so you'll have to struggle a little while you're holding the hot plate in one hand and eating with the other.

9251,"I had the worst experience of ordering online today, I saw Veg Dum Biriyani @ 59/- on the menu and from previous experiences of having good Veg biriyani from good veg restaurants, I ordered the same confidently, but little did I know as to what was in store for me.
I am a pure vegetarian and what was delivered to me was Chicken Biriyani, I was furious,Â  I called the hotel, he says, it is impossible on his part to have sent the wrong order and put the entire blame on the delivery guy, saying he had mulitple orders from the shop, hence he might have mixed up, while the delivery guy in return claimed that it was just 1 order from that shop so the question of mix up doesnt arise.
I dont know who lied,who was truthful, I lost Rs.59/- unnecessarily and had to order lunch again from elsewhere.",negative

Adorning the highest floor of Hotel Monotel is one such terrace bar perfect to let your hair down, relax and rejuvenate. Groovy music, flavourful shishas and unlimited booze - all of it sums up to a great time. I dropped here recently and the experience was nothing short of amazing.
From their selection of finest food, Crispy chilli baby corn and hariyali chicken Tikka were superb to start off with. In the mains, the aromatic Kashmiri pulao went really well with the rich and sumptuous currys like Saagwali Mutton and Murgh Irani. Salads and accompaniments of various sorts were great as well. Last but not the least, desserts! Sinful Malpuas and ice creams were the right choice to end the gala dinner.
It was indeed a night to cherish, all thanks to the warm hospitality by the management team of M-terrasse. Kudos to them for such an efficient service.",positive

1. Chicken hot and sour soup (5/5): Really yummy in taste.

2. Mushroom soup ( 3.5/5): Watery and very bland in taste

3. Chicken steam momo (4.5/5): Delicious. But the size of the momos served were smaller than previous occassions. Also, the chutney served was a bit more salty than reqd.

4. Chilly dry fish (4.5/5): Good quality and taste. The amount of veggies can however be increased.

5. Mushroom hakka chowmein (4.5/5): Taste wise very good but it needs to reduce the oil content . Also, there is some problem with the quality of prawns used.Need to work on that else it is good.

6. Hot garlic chicken (4.5/5): Tasty

8384,"Worst experience ever. Ordered chicken biriyani from this one and got fed up with my experience. I'm a pure biriyani lover , tried so many places but this is the worst experience ever. I don't know from which angle it looks like biriyani. There was no minimum fragrance of biriyani. You clearly will understand that they cooked the biriyani with some ready made biriyani masala which we can get in every grocery shop. Don't know how tasty the other cuisine are of this outlet but it was my first order from here and they ruined it totally. I ordered after checking the zomato rating so never expected this. Also the price is a bit high. Don't go for biriyani ever from it.

The assorted kebab platters is an amazing offer for two, as you can try at least three varieties of kebabs(fish tikka, chicken tikka and reshmi kebab) at extremely cheap rates.
The Biryani portion is humongous and it can be a waste if you take one plate for each person.
The Mutton Hanglabari is a compulsory try.
It's their signature dish and though it tastes a bit like Mutton Kosha, the grated coriander and the smoked flavour keep it distinguished.

It's definitely a place to go for Biryani lovers who are broke yet wanna eat a lot!",positive

The fried rice had Egg and chicken stips while the Garlic Chicken was on the Sweeter Side. The generous quantity of Garlic present in the gravy complimented the chicken to perfection.

As it is near to my college , its obvious i go very frequently to enjoy sumptous chinese foods.

Trust me the chowmein, thupka are just awesome... once u taste it , you will feel like visiting again n again.

Prices are too reasonable n affordable .

Quantity they serve is enough for 2.

Well cooked, fresh, delicious foods.
Services are even fast if there is not much crowd.

One issue is they have tools , chairs laid side by the lane , you have to eat sitting there. But its still awesome.
Who cares where you sit when u get to eat such terribly delicious foods âº",positive

Taste of rice had been flavourful, but unlike the conventional Kolkata biryani or even a Hyderabadi or Lucknowi/Awadhi biryani.
The tikkas in the rice had been fresh but felt could have been cooked a wee bit better for a tastier appeal.
Raita had been good but too spicy to be balanced with the flavour of biryani.

Though it cannot be placed among the first class, top-quality biryanis produced by some of the well-known restaurants in the city (like Oudh 1590, Arsalan or even Dum Pukht at ITC Sonar), or some other low-key popular places (Besstoo, Kabuliwala, @49) that serve some really tasty biryanis, the chicken tikka biryani from The Great Biryani Co. had nonetheless been quite appetising and delivered in more than sufficient quantity to whet one's appetite.",positive

Egg Chicken Cheese Dosa and a simple Egg Chicken Dosa. They were absolutely delicious. From the crunch to the amount of Stuffing inside, the Dosas were mindblowing. WoW, Will visit again.
O and yes, Finishing it with Chocolate Dosa.

If somebody loves dosa, This should be your no. 1 priority",positive
2545,Pappu Biryani House is one of those hidden gems that can still deliver good food at incredibly low prices.They make reasonably good chicken Biryani- one that is less oily but not less aromated than the regular ones. The chicken Kassa has four small pieces of chicken in a spicy gravy. Both are good.,positive

5916,"Food Junction at Valley Park, Garia is known for its Chinese, North Indian, Mughlai, Finger Food, kebabs and Hyderabadi cuisines. People mostly order its biryani with raita and tikka. I ordered chicken biryani egg kasha combo via Zomato. The delivery was prompt and the food taste was nice. They delivered salad and raita with my order which I relished. I would like to give them a rating of 3 out of 5.",negative
10383,"Very Peaceful and Calm restaurant. If you want to hangout with your friends or alone then this a good choice for natives . Although it's a small restaurant many families come here for a peaceful lunch or dinner or simply a lite dinner . Moreover an unique feature is that they have open air seating arrangement with a old Bengali theme which is absolute perfect for Adda.
Now coming to the which is basically Bengali and Chinese cuisine. There are lots of special Bengali thali which is really upto the mark. In the Chinese section one of the most preferred item is Chicken Momos which is really delicious and healthy. The Chinese items like fries rice and chili chicken are also highly sold items in this shop . Of you're finding a good restuarant in a reasonable rate them you must have a try....... Thank You",positive
3649,"The packing of the food is wonderful. However, they labelled the vegetarian burger as the non vegetarian burger and vice versa. Therefore, had I not been attentive, I would have had the wrong one.

We ordered the Cottage House Mafia and the Chika Licka Burger, along with french fries. The french fries were decently good. They were crisp and weren't soggy. Although, they were a little thicker.

The burgers tasted great. The smell of the burger when you open the packet ticks the right boxes and makes you want to jump in. I wish there were a few more pickled gherkins inside, which would add a twist to the taste.

I can see myself ordering from this place again, whenever I am in the mood for burgers. I hope they don't make the same mistake again.",positive

They also have outdoor seating, but I think they should have done far better there.
Coming to the food, it's good but not so fabulous. We had Tiger Beef I loved the taste, you will not feel that you are having beef.
Pizza was ok, Chicken Chapli was bekarr total waist of money.
In drinks you will get a wide range of liquors, was there was different cocktails. But we stayed into beer only.
For 3 people we paid 4k",positive

People have Bengali food in expensive restaurant but if you will one here you can have tasty food with good quantity in reasonable price. I have tried one veg thali and one mutton thali which was cost near about 600/-
And the quantity was just more than enough. May be it is not that much decorated as other restaurant but if you wanna try good food you should come in here once.
Love it.",positive
3408,"I had food delivered from Mamamomo via Zomato. 
The order was delivered on time. 
And, boy was it good! Very neat and impressive packaging, with no spillage.

Huge portions. They have a selective menu, but itâs kind of perfect, for someone who is just looking for momos or thukpa.

I ordered a portion of chicken steam momos and chicken chilli momos. Each plate contains 8/9 pieces of momos.
The filling was delicious, with a fine coating.

6007,"Often passing by the Ashoka Cinema would make my mouth watery. Though I am not a big fan of South Indian Cuisine , but United Cafe is what comes to my mind, when I think of South Indian Cuisine in Kolkata. I have been quite a few times here. It's a small and congested place. The service is the quickest of all. Dosa , Butter Onion Masala Uthapam and Aloo vada is their speciality. The Dosa is crispy outside with soft inside and aloo masala . The chutney served is fresh, having a distinct flavour of coconut and curry leaves. Uthappam and Aloo vada is a must try. If your taste buds demands South Indian flavour at Behala, it's United Cafe at the most reasonable price.",positive
4661,"Been to this place recently to try out their awesome cuisine. This is located just above Sumo Dough on the same building near Bhawanipore Education Society. The ambiance of this place is really cool with great seating and private dining spaces. This is one of the few place in that area that serves Shisha

We ordered 
Hungary Chicken â¹285
Toblerorone Shake â¹245
Fish Florentine â¹445
Hookah â¹295
Chocolate Cheesecake â¹225

The good part of this place is you can order from the menu card of Kath Koyla and Sumo Dough. 
The toblerone shake really stands out and the best i have tried. Donât miss out on the Fish Florentine. Its one of their best dishes. 
Overall a great ambiance to enjoy with your friends. Looking forward to visit again",positive
3322,"Amazing food! I simply loved the tonkatsu, the chicken with mayo (forgot name) and the platter (forgot name again). The ramen was great too, but could be better. Definitely going back! The service ,taste was on spot! Only issue is that it's a tad bit too congested!",positive
3513,One of my favourites in my locality. They serve both mughlai and chinese cuisine but I will recommend to try their chinese. I have tried almost all of their chinese items and I would say it has never disappointed me. Both the quality and quantity of food is very good. Their best preparation is schezwan chicken. They have such a popularity in our locality that the biriyani they cook only lasts for 1 hour only due to the demand.,positive
7969,A solid 3.5/5 for this roadside eatery! After completing our work at JU we decided to grab a quick lunch from an eatery nearby. We spotted this eatery and found it well cleaned compared to other eateries close by. We opted for fried rice and chilli chicken and one tandoori chicken! The amount was enough to suffice our hunger! The price pinch is low. I even packed the same for dinner!,negative
2413,This place needs special mention when it comes to sweets. I ordered Kesaria Abar khabo but sadly i was delivered with Kesaria Chum Chum instead and it was very scented. The Kesaria Rabri tasted good and the bhujia was like the regular ones.,positive

When the restaurant personnel came himself to deliver, he made me go all the way to our housing gate, and refused to make a doorstep delivery. I had paid by Paytm upfront, so I had to sort of put up with it.

Finally, they decided to send less portion of paneer , and instead of 8 pieces, they gave 6.

#ChristmasDiaries

I had heard about this place long back but couldn't manage to drop in till a couple of days ago..

Beautiful decor portraying the works of one and only #SatyajitRay and serving a variety of continental delicacies - it greets you with an old world charm the moment you step in..

I had very little time in hand and not much of an appetite since I had gone for a meeting - thought of settling down with a dessert and thank God I did so..

This #CaramelCustard was one of the best that you get in town specially bcz of the cream that it is topped with unlike anywhere else I have had it till date - makes it an even more delicious affair indeed.. Would love to go back soon to try out the remaining delicacies on the menu..

I was really disappointed with everything in the thali!

The rice had something greenish in it. It tasted weird.
The paratha wasn't even a paratha, just a fried roti. It was so hard I couldn't chew it, had to throw it away.
The chicken curry's gravy didn't taste good.
The dal was watery.
Instead of a gulab jamun they gave sooji.
The only decent item was the veg item.

Dry Chilly Fish - This one was properly prepared and was not too spicy.",negative

Well first of all they do serve authentic japanese dishes over here, so anyone (like me) looking to try out japanese cuisine , please do give this place a visit.
So far i have tried out
Nigiri sushi
Fish yakitori
Chicken teriyaki over here.
I didmt like the sushi much, others were great!
Among others, i have had chicken clear soup, mixed rice and roasted lamb.
They are all exrtremely well prepared!
But my own personal favourite is the yakitori preparation, which i end up having every time! ð",positive
9390,"Triasha Fast Food is located one corner of Bowbazar crossing just opposite of Tanishq Jewellery. I have been to this place once to twice and haven't found any thing much interesting.
There is hardly any place to seat, moreover due to its location it becomes difficult to have to food while standing in that busy footpath.
The food quality isn't good yet and in that price. They just taste little better then and footpath shops. The egg Chowmine is marked at Rs.70 for a full plate, is not at all Worthy and same for the other dishes.
There are much better places nearby offering good food at cheaper rate. Not much recommend.

So you can't able to see live matches if you are not near to those LCD. It was tipically made for ""darru bar"" type. It wasn't appropriate for family dinner or reunion type or any get together type. Staffs were okish type, food was good, service was fast.

But one thing that should be improve from my end that please increase your stocks of beers and increase your collection of scotch and imported whisky. Because it wasn't upto the mark. So please look into this matter.

Experience was good, food was good. Perfect place for booze but NEVER GO THERE FOR FAMILY DINNER OR GET TOGETHER OR REUNION.",negative

Both the dishes were really good and much recommended. In the main course we ordered Fish Belle Meuniere and Chicken Steak. The Fish was good, the Steak however wasn't that good.

Coming to the Vada pao, it's very famous from this place and it didn't disappoint. I had never had Khandwi before so decided to give it a go. It was nice but I found the chaat to be too sweet.

Very easy on the pocket too",positive

As suggested by the book it ritualistically makes 65 Prawn Cutlets everyday and yes it does run out in no time, so be there or be square. Most of the dishes are made with Pure Ghee and despite being heavy Oily dishes they manage to cook it miraculously in a very light manner which some of the cafes and restaurants in that area fail to do so. The Fish Cutlet was equally good along with the Chicken Steak, so simple yet so tasty, all cooked in pure ghee.Â I am definitely going back for more to try out everything else in the menu but in installments and so should one.",positive

Mutton pieces were pretty small, and 1 piece was total fat! Not that good in taste too.
Quantity of rice was good for one, But the dal and sabji given was flavourless! Absolutely worthless.
Moreover what shocking was they mixed the Alu bhaja and papad in one pouch, and quantity of each was meager!
Chutney was watery and too sweet. Absolutely not value for money! This shit costs â¹225. Dont even try to order from here , one will get better options in this price. They did not even send a spoon or napkin with it, even though we asked for it.

The shikanji was well made and so was the dahi papdi chaat. The mango kulfi is innovative to the core and quite literally so as they take the malai kulfi and stuff it onto slices of mango in a way that you get both in each bite.

My partner and I were overwhelmed with the taste and decided to visit once again. The desserts was poor compared to the other stuffs which were to be rated 5+.

686,"The ambiance to quite good, service pretty slow when the place is 75% occupied. My order included:
- Nibbles Grilled Prawn Skewers (pretty average, can be avoided, was a little dry)
- Crumb fried Chicken Breast filled with Turkey Ham (this one was good, but the chicken could have been juicier).
- Japalpeno Cheese balls (served with tomato salsa - good)
- Desserts Mezzuna Tasting platter with vanilla and panacota. (Cheese cake and mousse was brilliant, but the Panacota and creme brulee lacked the authentic taste).
- Long island iced tea and Budweiser

Tortilla de patatas (a preparation with mashed potato and boiled eggs) - Ate it for the first time so Iâm not very sure of how it should taste but I found it very eggy (2.5/5)
Customised veg pizza - perfect as I already mentioned (4/5)

Both of them are good enough but in them my recommendation will be for Chica Licka. It contains hell lot of grilled chicken, fried eggs, chicken bacon strips, chicken sausages and chicken salami topped with cheese. Lovely.

Wonton noodles (5/5) : This is the most famous item in there restaurant. Noodles are cooked in pork broth and it is accompanied by pork wontons. It is also called singhara chow. This one is my favorite.

Brown Chow(3/5) : it tastes same like Hakka noodles, but on a sweeter side. I liked this item.

Kaptai Soup(1/5) :This is pork organ soup. This item is not bad but it has a strong smell, which is unbearable. I personally didn't liked it .

Food - The pic is of murgh tikka kolhapuri. We ordered vegetable jhalfarezi and butter tandoori roti in addition.

Pocket pinch - 700 INR for 2.

Ambience - Chilled air conditioning, dimly lit with a miniature howrah bridge dividing the restro in two halves, and a separate bar counter and a great playlist. All you need to chillax.

Service - People are prompt but order delivery is slower than usual, but as they say ""fruit of patience is sweet"". Rate - 4/5.

Verdict - The food tasted great #GREAT and that is most important for me. My people loved the ambience and the music. I would have loved it if the service was faster. By the way they do not have an inhouse washroom, which is a great turndown.

The restaurant is also decorated by the fish net all around which makes the ambience different.
We ordered the below: 
Sea food coriander soup - first few spoons I liked it but after that the smell of seafood like oysters , snails ð became monotonous and feel like foul smell.
Steamed gondhoraj bhetki - its a fusion of indian and continental dish... i liked it but again after having half portion, I found the taste very blunt. May be being a bengali, we always crave for proper spicy à¦®à¦¾à¦ à¦à¦° item.
Ilish combo - My husband ordered it. The ilish bhapa came along with steamed rice with ghee, daal and begun bhaja.
This combi is a perfect lunch menu for any bengali. He loved it.

The other dish was jade noodles which was green noodles flavoured with spring greens and garlic.. This was the more subtle of the lot and was docile in its appeal...

I visited this place a week ago and I was really impressed seeing the dishes made with eggs. They can be a very good breakfast option.
A biryani joint serving delicious egg dishes are very very rare.

On my visit with my friends I tried out the,
â¢Tandoori Egg
â¢Scrambled Egg with bread
â¢Supper fluffy egg
â¢Devil's Egg
â¢Baked Egg

I would highly recommend the Baked Egg.
Also I tried out some kebabs like the Prawn kebab, Tangri Kebab.
For the main course I took the Chicken Tikka Biryani.

Kolkata is famous for kathi rolls, here I tried out the Chicken roll and Paneer Roll here.

Everything prepared really well. It's a super affordable place so you can visit here on a weekly basis too.",positive

Main course is lavish and has good varieties for veg and no vegetarians. Those who don't eat fish and mutton have good choices in chicken as well.
We found the seating very comfortable and the music sublime and suiting to the ambience. Would love to go again. Only issue we found was the Walla weren't clean, the pillars covered with wooden designs had insects on them, probably due to old wood not having been furnished.

2. Peach Ice Tea :- Very refreshing, served cold and chilled ;

3. Minty Mojito :- Good and very refreshing as usual ;

4. Bun Maska :- Two (2) pieces of bun with fillings inside. It was too good. Just sort of vada pav, bun maska was yummy and too delicious ;

Probably because it was very new then - all the restaurant staffs were overly polite.
It is to see whether then can maintain this hospitality with passing time.

We ordered 2 starters - chicken & fish.
The did customised the fish starter on our request.

The pieces were real big in size.

Asked a few people at the station and reached this non descript place - 3 minutes walk from Belghoria local station. 

The place was clean and well kept. First thing you notice about them is the crowd- takeaway food. This place is what you could describe as ""parar hotel"", mostly catering to the PG residents that thrive in the station area. 

Now , coming to the food. The order was confirmed swiftly. Specific instruction was given to make it absolutely minimal spicy. 

The chicken was nicely made. However, it seems the particular request fell on deaf ears. The gravy was made over the top spicy and generous amount of chilly slices were visible everywhere. 

Made things really hard for both of us, somehow we managed.

Also, there is no parking space and the outlet is bang on a very busy traffic signal. So ppl are forced to park far far away and walk from there.
Even the staircase within the property scares me coz one needs to carry a tray(s) full of food up and down the stairs and they re steep and winding. Someone is (or already has) bound to drop it all there. Plus this outlet becomes completely non 'disabled-friendly' for the aforementioned reasons.

The space is real jammed up. Its a small cozy place with air-conditioning and 2to levels. The ambience simple. Service average.

Coming to the food this is a joint for the budget goers and keeping that in mind the price at which they offer its quite good. The main courses, fried rice and noodles was quite good. Though the hakka noodles tasted a bit blunt. The szechwan chowmein was tear dripping spicy.

The side dished were average. Chicken pieces were well sized but lacked the juices inside. The suaces were well cooked. Overall a budget friendly place to dig in some chinese dishes.",negative

We agreed to his suggestion and in 15 minutes, two plates of steaming hot fried pork arrived at our table. At first glance, the quantity was drop down disappointing. The taste made up for it to some extent. The pork was well fried, was crisp, and went well with the dip they provided with it.

10060,There Was A Time When I Used To Visit This Place Just To Have Their Crispy Chicken. Its A Good And Affordable Place To Kill Your Hunger. Love Their Crispy Chicken.

1373,"This place is located in sarat base road and its very easy to locate.It is just walking distance from rashbehari avenue.
The place is really small and can accomodate around 10 people or less.They are also have zomato gold tag which was good.
The food here was good.i felt not exceptionally good but year not bad either.Thus im going with 3.5 stars.We had their special latt-me-kai dish which was kind of a starter and it was good,little spicy which we wanted.One thing i dint like about this dish was that it was full of chopped garlic.but anyways it was overall tasty.
Then we had pan fried chicken noodles which also had mushrooms in it.The pan fried noodles were good but as they said it was their specialty i dint find it to be exceptional again.Infact latt me kai was better.The noodles were not fried properly aswell.
The service of overdose was really good.They were really humble and always at beck and call.",negative

Situated at the roof top of Lindsay Hotel, this place offers one of the best views of the Calcutta Skyline. With twinkling lights all around, this is a perfect place for a date.
Even with Zomato gold, this place is a priced on the higher side, but the ambience is worth it.",positive
8282,The best place that I had rolls from. Had an egg roll for 30 and an egg chicken kathi roll for 60 rupees.

1724,We went there on shashthi afternoon. It was pretty crowded ! We had to wait for half an hour. Then we also had to share a table. The menu was changed too. They didn't have any dessert or cocktails on their new puja menu. We ordered a egg hakka noodles and one prawn hakka noodles and one Shanghai chicken. Food was normal. Costs us 660 with all taxes.,negative
7281,The egg hakka noodles and Veg Noodles are great. The Kashmiri Pulao could have been better. The preparations are less spicy and have just the right amount of spices to make the dishes delightful.,positive

1782,"Yesterday evening Astami night thought to try some Bengali dishes and so we went to this restaurant. It's located in Ballygaunge bondel road..easy to reach from my place.We already booked seats to avoid crowd as it was puja time. The restaurant decoration was simple and light was dim.Now coming to the Food in Starter --- ordered Fish Finger was yummy and in Main Course we ordered - ""Steamed rice was good but quantity was not enough... and""Mutton Stew with Gandhraj leaves""...Mutton was tender and got the taste of Gandhraj in stew...it was really nice... and the ""Achari Chingri Malai Curry"" was good enough in taste...loved it but sad about the prawn size it was too small ....lastly in dessert we ordered ""Mustard and tender coconut mousse""...it was awesome in one word. Price -- was comparatively high. Staffs were helpful and courteous.There should be more varieties in Bengali dishes.",negative
1881,"I have a mixed opinion of this place having a moderate ambience. The service was good and the food was good too. However, if you order without looking on the right side of the menu, you will surely get a heart attack upon getting the cheque served to you. The pizza was tasting good until i realized that its worth more than 500 and the only topping it had was of cheese, tomato sauce and some tiny pieces of chicken here and there along with droplets of feta. Similar experience was with my plain white sauce pasta (costing about 350), which not even had basic veggies and was topped only with chicken, where the chicken add-on costed about 75, making the total cost to about 425 (just plain white sauce pasta and little pieces of chicken with no veggies). C'mon guys, that price is fair only if your dish has other veggies as topping too, e.g. olives, onion, capsicum, jalapenos and corns.",negative

1942,"Today again in a team lunch we explored an entirely new place ie XII Zodiac. The name itself suggest to be something unique. Also a nice place to get mind blowing pics.

We opted for the buffet for around 14 people. It had a nice ambience and a great seating arrangement for us. Hassle free scheduling for prior booking. As the name suggests it was based on the Zodiac theme.

Initially we were served a combo of ""5 element of nature"" and that was quite unique. Later we had the starter with a complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic). The starters had a wide variety with some preparations which I never had before. Mushroom balls, chilly fish, chicken Tikka are few which I loved the most. Apart from that there was live counter, a wide range of items for the main course and sweet dishes.

Altogether had a great experience however the service is bit slow.",positive
11076,"This place was at a stone throw distance from my school. However, i have been there only once. It is basically a take away join with only 2 tables and few chairs.. Had only tasted their biryani back when i was in school.. It didn't quite appeal to my taste buds.. It was oily and the chicken piece in the biryani was hard.. But given the price, i guess nothing much can be expected..",negative

It is a little expensive but no complains cause we had a good time! Wanted to try the cocktails but had to leave as we had a spa session booked. Over all, it was an amazing and relaxing experience.

10797,"This restaurant is among one of the oldest restaurants which is located in the middle of new market. You can just fill your stomach spending Rs 200 for one and Rs 500 for two for having lunch or dinner here. The quality and quantity of the food is also up to the mark. One can get a heritage feeling having food here as this is a very old restaurant and small open cabins are also there.

I have ate here many times. On last visit me and my partner took mutton fried rice and mixed fried rice and a quarter of boneless chilly chicken and a plate of green salad. Both the rice was good in terms of quality and quantity however the portion of chilly chicken was not warm. Altogether one can have good food at an affordable price here.",negative

1. Chicken Butter Masala
2. Tandoori Naan
3. Biryani
4. Chicken Butter Masala
Chicken Butter Masala tasted unique and quite different from the other restaurants. The Naan was soft and warm. The Paneer Tikka Masala was spicy and delicious. The biryani was savoury as well as spicy.

1645,"Been here for dinner with Romit tonight i.e. 21-dec-18.
Good ambience - spacious seating - nice interior.
A sooting background music would have been nicer.

The toilet is clean - but single, hence there will be queue if multiple customers need to use at the same time.

Food is a bit expensive, but taste & quality wise really satisfactory.

We ordered a mocktail with cucumber_lemon-mint & they made it on our request.
We orfered stir fry chicken & dim sum - they were delicious. They also fulfilled our request to make a tasty n spicy chilli dip for the dimsum.",positive

We faced difficulty while choosing the menu as there were so many different types of Dosa.Whatever,we took Waffle dosa that was yummy, Rava onion butter masala dosa which was heavy and then Mysore Idli..big enough for two.
Service was very fast,Staffs are polite..Pocket friendly place.Overall a good place to have your south Indian breakfast done.",positive
2016,"The Ravioli here is so beautifully made that I still have the flavour lasting on my tongue. The sauce just the right amount of tangy and a tiny tiny bit of spicy. They served the Arancini di pollo, which I personally didnât like much, and they compensated that with their panacotta. O dear lord, it was heavenly ! I loved it.",positive

9909,Went to this restaurant on 18th Oct'18 which was Nabami during Durga puja to have dinner with family after visiting FD block Salt lake Puja.... full credit for managing the queue so well during the rush on that day. They have a seperate section for chatting and gathering with friends which is quite nicely decorated. Coming to food quality...we had some north indian dishes and it was average....but not bad....overall good experience....service was quick but one complain is that the glass which was given for filling water was not cleaned properly....hence little disappointed.... however not sure whether this was due to the huge pressure or it is usually same in other days also,positive

I tried cheese maggi (costed 55rs) from this place, quantity wise it was really good and taste wise was okayish. This place has quite many options to offer, pure veg. Maggi lovers like me can definitely try their different varieties of maggi.

They maintained the food quality and the taste. I had pudina paratha and one chicken dish. I liked the paratha most because it was soft inside but crispy in outside.

Basically this is a hall on the ground floor of a tourist lodge,where the boarders and outsiders have their meals.The speciality lies in the menu,which keeps changing everyday to avoid monotony.Typical Bengali items cooked with a homely feel is their USP.Being a pice hotel,none comes here for a dazzling interior design or nobody expects a romantic atmosphere.What wins over the foodies is simplicity submerged in the unique savour.
One of a few places which stands for great foods and nothing else.",positive

1409,"This is to be noted that the rating I've given is only for the food and decor. Coming to the staff behaviour, the place gets 1 star here. Staffs there, are arrogant and have an insulting manner of reacting to any situation. Food was good though. We had spaghetti A. O. P and nonveg platter (noodles, chicken wings and chilli fish). The spaghetti dish tated really nice but I doubt whether they have used the spaghetti pasta or not, considering the thickness of the noodles. The place can be visited for a second time to have food but the hospitality needs to be improved and the staffs there need to take a serious lesson to deal with their behavior.",positive

1972,I have been going to the restaurant from.last 6 years but never got chance to review it. It is one of my favorite destination for Chinese food in gariahat area. The staffs have always been courtesious and quantity and quality of food is always been up to the same quality. Red wine chicken is my favorite dish in this place. Another one is egg burnt garlic rice. One plate of any dish is sufficient for two people here and quality is also good.,positive
4294,"The place is very easy to locate. The ambience resembles that of a local train,with quirky sign boards hung in the wall to the graphitti design. The best thing about this place is its menu. The menu has some really funny and quirky names for its dishes.
The dishes are also presented very well.
We tried:
1)Bhaji Pav Mastani- This was accompanied with a full loaf of bun btead,with butter,onions and a painter's brush toh apply the butter on your Pav. The bhaji tasted amazing. Though it is a bit pricey as far as I think.
2) Rapchik Rasberry - This drink was given jn a small glass bottle. The drink had this soury and sweety taste of rasberries. A must try.",positive

They ensured everything was fine at any point of time. Always smiling and very co-operative. One can choose to enjoy their evening over the Hookah, Food & Beverages. Can't really complain about the quality, as it's top class considering the price they charge.

And we had absolutely no idea that veg rolls can be so tasty. Price is also very reasonable.We tried few items mentioned below-

â Baked pizza roll- Had pizza toppings inside it and lots of cheese. (Personal favourite)

â Paneer kathi roll- paneer was soft and the roll was very flavourful. Liked it too.

â Peri peri twister- I had tried the twister before, but this potato twister was crunchy and flavourful as well.

â Bhoot jolokiya roll- It was the spiciest roll I have ever tried.we had to take coke to finish it. So think twice before placing your order.

â Nutella banana roll- banana pieces with nutella . Though I didn't like the combo that much.

So roll it out is one kind of fusion roll centres and they have done a great job so far.",positive

Food items: Ordered mixed noodles and chili chicken for dinner. Two mixed noodles is enough for three. The chili chicken is a farce in the name of chili chicken. The coating is extremely thick and the gravy tastes like a thick broth of tomato juice and vegetables floating around.

First, the food was delivered in time. Foods were up to the mark in taste. The only problem I had was - the delivery guy did not have enough cash to exchange my payment. Anyway, we sorted it out somehow.
So, in nutshell, I liked the service and quality of foods from zomato and Marwar respectively. Hence the high rating...",positive
4134,"This place was on my wishlist for long. The last time there was no ilish mach available but this time thankfully I got to try their Ilish Bhapa. It was very well prepared. I think they should not limit their ilish dishes to bhapa. They should also introduce other dishes of ilish in online ordering.
I had also ordered papad and plain rice. I would have liked it more if rice was basmati.
Prices are fair. Overall it was a pleasant experience.",positive
10088,"Went there for a weekday lunch. Found a lot of things on the menu with south Indian priority, but not necessarily. So decided to go for a full thali @ Rs 110/- (theres also a mini thali which doesnt include Poori @ Rs 90/-) Got 3 pooris, sambhar, aloo dry sabzi (the one used in masala dosa filling), 2 papads, butter milk, sheera, rice and a white kadhi which reminded me of Gujarati style sweet kadhi. Â Â 

The taste of food is average, but fresh. I expected atleast a rasam and one more veggie to go with the rice and poori. Anyways, its not disappointing either, as rates are reasonable. Its a busy street eatery and basic in approach. One of those few places in strand road where you can sit, order and be served a peaceful meal. I will go again to try dosas and other south Indian items.",negative

I had Dairy dark waffle over here and it was so chocolaty and so delicious. Golden waffle stuffed with milk chocolate and topped with a big kf dark chocolate. This is a must try here.

The only dissapoinment I have regarding this place is, once I ordered Nutella waffle from this place via zomato and the waffles were delivered soggy and cold. This wasn't expected.

At the entrance of this restaurant you'll see a monkey seating in a bench entering, you'll see a elephant raising it's trunk, hear a lion's roar, live waterfall if you go to a little close proximity you'll see crocodiles, tortoises and a number of wild animals! Stairs are made up of tree's trunk and they looks so real! Now, coming to the food, among the starter we had Malai chicken tikka kebab along with sweet lime soda, both were mouth melting.

What was special about the starters were the two chinese starters they were simply mind blowing and you cannot resist asking for more. Then the main course had a number of varieties both in chinese and indian, veg and non veg. They were pretty good. Specially the rice items and the mutton side. The desserts have a huge number of variety and i promise by the time you reach the desserts section you would regret having just one stomach to fit in all the gluttony.

The staff kept on serving 1 each of veg & non veg item where as there were 4 starters. On asking, the staff kept on asking for more time. We had to wait for 35 mins to get fish fry. When asked the duty manager, he had no answers.. The food spread at the buffet was cold & there was no proper refill inspite of repeated reminders.

It's a big cafe with 2 storeys, one for dining and the storey above they have turned into a beautiful lounge with a huge screen and few booths even where you can enjoy hookah. Each booth has separate game stations which is really incredible and unique.
Coming to food, we tried a Cheese Omlet and their signature HURRICANE.
The cheese omlet was soft and succulent, served with fried potato mash and boiled tomato. The egg tasted good.
The Hurricane was a tangy drink, served wonderfully as you can see in the picture.
Overall a nice experience and would love to visit again.",positive

5909,"A decades old eatery that serves very good Bengali food cooked by Oriya & Bengali âThakurâs.
Mangovind Ponda from Odisha started this hotel in Kolkata in 1927 in the name of âHindu Hotelâ. Being a youth leader, #netajisubhaschandrabose was its regular food-eater. Not only had that, several freedom fighters, includingÂ Rishi Aurobindo, lunch and dinner here. Not only did they indulge in its amazing delicacies, but they also hid here during their revolution. Post independence, the name was changed to its present one on January 25. Even today, this hotel teems with Bengali customers, everyday.
""Swadhin Bharat"" means #independentindia ... That talks about the time when this restaurant opened.
Water was served in bhar (kulhar / earthen pot).
Food was served on banana leaf atop steel plate.
One of our old tradition remains through such wonderful hotels in the city.",positive

The experience was as âGrandâ as I expected, from this vintage hotel of the Oberoi Group in the city of joy. I already have prior experiences of their hospitality in other cities, which is one of the best in our country for sure and they lived up to my expectation this time too.

The icing on the cake (pun intended) was the complimentary yummy birthday cake they offered. Truly an experience worth remembering.",positive
386,"Went to this restaurant during lunch.

The ambience and the friendliness of the staff was very comforting. Especially their staff called Ria made an excellent hostess.

Ordered half rack of bbq pork rib and the chicken burrito.

The burrito was good to taste and was thoroughly enjoyed. However, the rib could use a little more time in the heat as the meat was just short of falling off the bone. Taste wise the rib was decent. The mashed potato had a few lumps in it and I even got a few bits of potato peel in my mouth while eating. Could be much better.",negative

Going through the positive reviews, I thought of giving a try and I am glad that I tried. I ordered an egg chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken.
The quantity of the rice was huge though, easily can be shared. The hot garlic chicken was spicy and hot, containing six succulent Boneless chicken pieces, went really well with the rice. Pocket pinch is reasonable enough.

Overall had a great experience, going to order again soon. All the best to the team Hunger Delizia.",positive

Coming to the food, the noodles didn't seem to be fresh a d the lamb was very poorly cooked and served in a chilly gravy which had big pieces of vegetables and no taste.

The price is nominal and the quantity served is also proportionate.

However their service is very nice. But for a restaurant I would recommend them to upgrade their quality of the food. As the restaurant is in a very good location but without good food it will not be worth it.",negative

4321,"Crystal Chimney is located in Chandni Chowk opposite to E-Mall . It is a very small outlet with 22 seats only. We didn't like Ambience , you can feel little unhygienic there . Let's talk about food now .
We ordered -
â¢ Crispy Chilly Baby corn
â¢ Chicken Lollipop

Crispy Chilly Baby corn - It was very crunchy and tasty . But excessive sweetness of the sauces killed the main taste ... So overall taste is not that great . You can ask for less sweetened version .

Chicken Lollipop - same gravy was used ( as used in baby corn ) . So the problem was same .

Positive part was quality and price ..

I am sure guys you have never tried this Indianised version of fried rice. I recommend you guys to try their fried rice because it is tastier than their biryani. Biryani is alright but not that grand. Well last time when I had their biryani they provided us 2 chicken leg pieces.ð.

The dessert GAJAR KA HALWA had a large portion can be easily shared among 2-3 people. The food was satisfying so was the pricing. Staff need to be quick and more attentive.",positive

For this particular outlet, the food standard and prices are as usual but there is one problem here which is the seating capacity and table arrangements. It is a small place but at the same time too congested if the restaurant is full.
No other complaints about the food but I would personally prefer going to the other outlets just for the better ambience.",positive

Chicken do piyaza was very tasty but I wish they would either give bigger pieces or at least 4 pieces as 3 pieces is too less I feel. Will surely order more!",positive

We had smoked chicken salad, spaghetti, penne arabiatta, yakitori chicken, spinach dimsums, prawn cocktail. The prawn cocktail and the spinach dimsums were definitely something new to us and both tasted excellent. Rest was pretty good too. In drinks we had, LIIT, Beach party, Watermelon margarita and cosmopolitan. The drinks were unique in the blend, but the Cosmopolitan, beach party and LIIT caught our attention.

Once you take the jetty from eco park, you have two options here, one is a Bengali cuisine restaurant and the other is the Chinese cuisine houseboat one. We went for the latter. Ordered chicken hot pepper soup, pan fried chicken Chowmein and another chicken semi gravy dish. The food and the quantity is sufficient for two people. Taste wise was nice and the best part is obviously the ambience. Eco park closes early but the restaurant serves till 10pm, after which they provide you with a small motor boat to ferry you back to eco park for the exit. I loved the food, ambience and service. You can also rent out cottages in eco park if you want to enjoy the tranquility for a longer time.",positive

After many years while passing by, on a rainy afternoon the fond memories just dragged me inside the establishment. The ambiance is still the same at its basic, no frills or cutlery. But what matters over here is the food. Was curious to know if the taste is still the same or deteriorated with time. As an old habit ordered my all time favourite combo of Special Fried Rice and Roast Pork.
Ummm, the same taste of the flavor-some meaty fried rice and smoky soya sauce chili double fried succulent pork they are still consistent with its flavor. For Tung Nam fans must try out pork here.
They don't accept plastic money or e-wallet. Prices in the menu are including tax. Each portion was enough for two of us to share. Pocket pinch was only INR 520 inclusive taxes.

I tried the Thread Chicken and the Chicken Peshawari for starters. The Peshawari was succulent and delicious while the Thread Chicken was crunchy and amazing !
For main course I tried the Lemon Steamed Fish with fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken. The Rice was to die for and the Chicken was very tasty !
I ended my dinner with a Shahi Tukda which wasnât overwhelmingly sweet so it was great !

I need to mention the Momo was excellent in taste. U will heardly found good quality of momos from this kind of QSR outlet. The chicken 65 was only spicy it was not authentic but still I like the taste. On the 2nd day I told delivery boy to bring spicy sauce but the outlet given Hotgarlic dip which was Actully more sweet.

We ordered Rava Dosa, Filter Coffee and Coca cola. The dosa was well tossed with butter stuffed with tangy potato curry. The sambar was so up to the mark that made me overwhelmed. I'm not a South Indian food lover but this place made me fall in love with it.Talking about filter coffee it disappointed me. It was way too bitter than usual. Curtain calling it, a typical South Indian will cherish visiting the place and of course it deserve special mention as a saviour for the shopping freaks to rest and have a quick bite.

The decor is soothing and minimalist and the staff was courteous and took our feedback on the food. I don't see any reason why this place has such low rating. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for some items. There is no way a glass of thums up should cost â¹45+GST.

I would not recommend to try their Chinese. The Chowmenin tasted very average and the chicken pieces in the chowmein were not adequate.

Stuffed fried idly was indeed very good. Perhaps one of the best I've have had over the years.

When we checked it we found the masala along with grated panner. There was no cheese in it. The sambar was just horrible.

The baked rashgulla didn't impress my taste buds much. It didn't taste like it was properly baked.

That is NOT how Daab chingri is cooked. It is cooked by putting the prawn and paste inside the coconut and heating the coconut itself in an oven. From a restaurant like Oh Calcutta, (having tasted one) I expected an original Daab Chingri.
The Kasundi Kakra dish tasted good - but though the menu mentions deshelled crabmeat - in actual it comprises of less of crab meat and more of flour batter. I did not found it to be at par with the price.Murgh Malai Tikka was tasty.The Daab Sondesh, Payesh though stole the show.

- Fattoush Salad
- Exotic Falafel
- Veg Submarine
- Wraps
- Peri - Peri Twister
- Cheese Maggi
- Peach & Apricot Shake
- Brownie with Ice- Cream

Overall the food is good. They don't compromise on the quantity of the ingredients they add. I loved the Salad & the Shake the most, but i feel Maggi & Potato twister needs a lot of improvement.",negative

Here I tried out some of the dishes. Some were genuinely good but also some needs real improvement.

My recommendations are:

Mocktails :
Fire and Ice - Refreshing with a spicy kick.
Paan Shot - Very unique to it's taste, the paan masala truly enhanced the taste.

Appetizers :
Tandoori Aloo
Crispy Chilli Babycorn

Main Course :
Paneer Shabnam
Kaali Daal
Garlic Naan

Also you can try out the,
Jalepeno n olive naan
Masala kulcha
Veg Biryani. About the Veg Biryani, It's not like a typical biryani though but it's nice.

as bad as the pizza but i wish they would have
made it a bit more spicier.

The mohito was good too. But the rice, was too bland. Packchoy wasn't to my taste.
The staff was polite and decent, but felt clueless about the dishes. Pricing wise it was around 700/head without alcohol. The ambiance was nothing too great either.
What compelled me to rate this place so low was that the next day, all of us feel sick with a bad stomach. So there you have it. Go there only if you want to risk having a sick day.",negative

We then again came back maybe after 2 mins and we get to see that the waiter instead of calling us asked someone else to enter. When asked he said that you people were not present. I mean what is this... We were just outside waiting, he could have called us right... I don't remember that person's name but he is way too disgusting.

It was full of Chicken pieces. The chicken pieces were mostly in kebab forms which multiplied its taste. They were layered with a thick gravy and onions which is the main attraction of the Rolls I guess.

I would suggest to consume it at the shop only right after serving because then it remains hot and fully crispy. The crispness goes away if you bring it home because it gets cold till then.

Very nice experience. Really liked their Roll. Will order their other rolls for sure. A big Thumbs up ð.",positive

Chicken tikka was spicy and good, just hoping not to find their name listed with the food quality control department someday. As far as packaging for delivery is concerned, it was very bad.

Because of small place inside of this restaurant, people prefer to parcel it. Even for parcel you have to stand in a long queue. Now talking about the biriyani- it's very rich and spicy but very tasty. They give only one piece of mutton / chicken in one packet of biriyani. If you take special biriyani then you will get 2 pieces of meat, and obviously Kolkata style biriyani can not be completed without a big spicy aromatic aloo.
Overall value for money and good deal for money.",positive

I want to mention one thing and that is the Butter Chicken doesn't taste like Butter Chicken at all. I don't know what it tastes like but it's tasty so no complains.

The outlet is pocket-friendly, food items available here are mostly prepared by chefs from the Indismart Hotel. Have noticed few things, firstly the items get out of stock before evening almost so food available here are always very fresh. Secondly the preparations are clean & hygienic, & the best part is they taste really good.

Have tried the brownie chocolate, chicken puff, sausage hot dog from the confectionary point. Now they have added a live counter recently where we tried fried chicken with chips & mayonnaise dip, fish fry with fresh fries & dip. Honestly all the items I tried were great in taste especially the brownie & fish fries & the price is cheaper than most of the places I know of.

Worth a try if you looking for small but fast grab, make sure you go before evening 7.",positive

The service is superfast and the waiters pay due attention to the customers. The chutney served alongwith masala dosa is thick and tasty and the same goes for the sambar dal. However, the potato stuffing inside the dosas is a bit soggy and due to that the dosas loose their crispness very soon. I would suggest them to use dry potato curry as stuffing to retain the unique taste of their jumbo sized dosas.That apart, the place is ok for a pocket friendly meal.",negative

Quesadillas were great and truly loved the generous filling of spinach and cheese. The tortillas were a bit crunchy and the warm cheese filling is sure to leave your tastebuds wanting for more. It was one of the best quesadillas I have had in Kolkata. [4/5]
The Pizza was truly disappointing. The crust was very dry from the first bite. Also, the cheese just fell off on being bitten.

It was complete package for Rs 199.
We ate Aloo Cheese Roll , Paneer Cheese Roll , Potato Twister , French Fries.
Both the rolls tasted excellent & were healthy as well but i felt the cheese given was bit less.

1. Tandoori Litti and Achaari Litti with Desi Ghee :- Two (2) pieces of each with aloo chokha, tomato bharta and green chutney.

First of all litti was very hard and too much dry;

Secondly, the quantity of Litti dissapointed me as they are offering only two (2) pieces of Litti at much higher prices compared to other 'Litti Shops' opened in the city.

Chokha was good and so was bharta ;

2. Cheese Pav Bhaji :- It was ok, nothing extraordinary ;

3. Sattu Paratha :- With mint chutney and pickles, sattu paratha was good but instead of mint chutney it should have been complemented with curd or raita which would have been much better choice.

Overall it's better for one time only.",negative

Chicken Biryani @ Rs.90 (3/5) :

Biryani was delivered in a paper box little bigger than usual. Biryani was tightly packed & rice seemed of okey quality. It was super rich in colour so was its aroma. A gigantic & soft chicken piece was present along with egg & ofcourse potato that was also very soft. But taste wise it was overwhelmed with its aroma & wasn't really delicious.

Egg fried rice
Egg Hakka noodles

Pizzas are really good here. They cook it so well.

I had 4 toppings thin crust Pizza, that was topped with tossed onions, mushrooms, tomato and olives. And a bit of cheese added to it. Tasted so good must say.

We ordered only two dishes as we weren't hungry but just wanted to try out their food. The fried rice was very tasty but the chicken item wasn't that good. The chicken was tasting stale and a bit smelly.

A clean washroom is a thing that restaurants should put some importance to. And, Aafter 9 gets a big 5 in this matter. They have clean washrooms separately for men and women.

I hope they bring some improvements and serve better food. Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

But the owner was kind enough for arranging some seating arrangement for me. Ordered a beef burger. Took about ten minutes to prepare it and be served Infront of me. The first bite and I had fallen in love with the burger. My oh my it was great! The beef patty soft and succulent, the fries perfectly cooked and the dip perfectly balanced with all kinds of sauce and spices. Hands down one of the best place in Kolkata to satisfy one's crave for good ol' burgers.
The only downside is the location. Tucked in the interior of Kasba one dosen't easily come across the place. Had a talk with the owner and he had told me that they would shift somewhere more easily accessible. So hopefully that does happen quickly for I haven't been able to take out time and go there the second time for its location.

Now coming to the java grilled fish, it was rich on spices. It tastes best with Kai pad pak. Teriyaki egg fried rice is ordinary. It is bland so it goes well with Java grilled fish as well. Japanese teriyaki chicken is also simple yet elegant. You can combine it with Hakka chicken noodles. You wonât be disappointed!

Coming to food, for starters, we were served fish kobiraji and battered fiah. With fresh water verkiezingen, you can't really go wrong and it were good here also. Gor main course, crab kosha was simply superb. The next recommendation would be pabda bori jhol with plain rice. The hilsa with mustard was fiery enough and fish was really fresh. Dab chingri could've been slightly better and id really prefer mid sized prawn (rather than large ones served here) to soak in more of the flavor. Surprisingly, the vegetarian selection was fantastic. Dhoka r dalna and chharar dalna really stood out.

Overall, recommended.

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 2.5/5
Service - 3/5
Value for money - 4/5

We had a chinese combo thali of chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. And chicken drumsticks. The food was tasty and fresh.

The restaurant itself is difficult to locate at first site and the space inside won't be able to cater a lot of people.

The service was a little slow compared to the fact that we were the only people eating in that time. But the staff were courteous

The price tags of the dishes are decent enough as per the taste.",negative
3641,"Ordered food from this outlet through zomato. The eatery is situated near Sulekha more and have seen this place many times while passing by. We ordered Pan fried fish, barbeque chicken and crispy chilly chicken. The fish was soft and juicy and prepared in a sweet chilly sauce. The barbeque chicken was tasty too and tossed in  bbq sauce. The crispy chicken contained multiple boneless pieces of chicken tossed with onion and bell peppers and the crispy yet juicy nature of the dish made this one special.The packaging of food was also nice.",positive

Since the table was pre booked and the occassion was known to the authorities, they had kept our table decorated with rose petals. We loved the decoration and the hospitality. The atmosphere inside is subtle and nice. Thanks for making the night beautiful.
All that a place like this which has made a reputation for itself by being the best is to continue being the best and find out ways to further surprise its patrons. Will be back soon to find out how they amaze me again...",positive

The first one needless to mention is one of the finest fried rice that I tried in recent days - the right blend of sauce along with mushroom chicken egg was simply awesome
The honeycrisp fish was a starter which had a right blend of honey and crispnesss of fish. There were plenty... I love their food and will visit again and again",positive

Food item 1 : Mutton kasha was ok. A bit on the sweeter side though.

Conclusion : Local inhabitants can grab a parcel from here in small party or family get together. Not heavy on Pocket book. Rs 450/- can stuff two..",negative
909,"One of the good chinese restaurant in Tangra. The ambiance is good. This place is huge.
We ordered bunch of beers and whiskey with following foods..

Chili Pork - The taste was very good. But one thing, the pork was mostly coated. It reduces the taste.
Golden Fry Fish - Fish taste was quite good.
Golden Fry Prawn - It was awesome. Prawns are too good.
Chicken Fry - It was good in taste.
French Fries - not so good in taste.

A not so big yet cozy take home outlet at Hindustan Park,on the footpath always having huge orders from customers.A wide array of Chinese,Continental and Bengali combo packs can be found there day long.
Foods tasted nice and what I liked most was the freshness.Paella was brilliantly cooked having sufficient chicken chunks,Prawns and ham shreds.Risotto was also very aromatic and cooked nicely.All foods were packed with great care.Equitable price of foods also give exact value for money.There is no seating arrangements,so no question of ambience.Precisely,take your food,go home and enjoy the great dishes.Quantity and quality both are to be guaranteed for.

I ordered a plate of chicken biryani from Foodpanda. The biryani was okay. You get a good quantity of rice , one potato and one decent piece of chicken. No egg. Since I bought it on an offer I got it at 79 INR. Hence it was well paid off. But without the offer it's 120 INR which I find a tad bit expensive as compared to the quality.

8610,"A very very unhealthy & unhygienic cookwares & kitchen space used for cooking all food items. Food quality is below average, very spicy, oily & very very unhygienic. Moghlai Paratha & pakora was the best seller of this fast food joint but at present this 2 food items also lost it's taste & quality. Most importantly very very unprofessional & rude behavior provided as service to many customers. There is no fixed cook/ chef. All the staffs there can cook even the owner can cook himself!!! That's the main reason for below average food quality.",negative
3533,"Not a very big place. They can accommodate around 20-25people at a time. The biriyani and chicken kasha is a bit sweet. The quality of the food is also not that good.

I ordered paw bhaji - it was really yummy.
The packaging was poor, the quality of the box used was cheap and also not closed properly.

Overall its a decent experience - wud really rely on it for my further late night hunger pangs (if u guys continue this quality)",positive

9534,"I landed up at this outlet in hunger and the ambiance is the worse I've come across in all my restaurant endeavours.
Ordered:
Jeera rice- The rice was average in taste and the quantity was less.
Chicken Tikka Masala- The taste was good with a claggy gravy but the pieces of chicken could have been a little more tender.
Despite being a family restaurant it had an ambience of a typical roadside bar with minimal leakage of light in the morning. The restaurant seems to be dark and stinky in the morning.",negative
6181,The place is good and clean with adequate seat arrangement. It is no popular restaurant at all. And the reason is it's ordinary taste of food items and high rates. A chicken burgy made combined with lettuce has been delivered with no distinguished taste and less value for money. They must look for a new food preparer asap to compete with other local restaurants. #sovanspeaks #chickenburger,negative

9823,"I visited this restaurant during pujas. I had to face very bad experience. Most of the actual items were not there and only a few items were present which really very overpriced. We ordered Chicken Bharta which cost us Rs260, which was very much for the quality given to us. We also ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. It cost us Rs350 bucks for 6 Pcs. I felt like I was being robbed being seaten in an AC restaurant. A piece of Tandoori Roti cost us Rs 40 bucks. What kind of pricing is that? After paying a heck lot, even the quality was below par. I will never visit his restaurant again and I would also not recommend it to anyone. Pathetic but unforgettable experience.",negative
4000,"This is one of the local food joints near my house which has done good for itself. Has few seating arrangements on the footpath just in front of the restaurant. Their biryani is definitely cheap but not at all compromising the quality. Their home delivery is though annoying, mostly you'll find their home delivery phone to be switched off. Their biryani sells off really fast.",positive
5730,"This place has a very casual ambiance. Nothing worth mentioning regarding that.
The drinks are sorta cheap but the food is a little on the costlier side. We had ordered for 2 tuborg and 1 Blender's pride. For food we ordered Hakka chicken which had small pieces of chicken tossed in bell peppers and onions. It was okayish. The pan fried noodles were disappointing. It was covered with gravy which consisted of bell peppers, baby corn and broccoli. The noodles were clumped together and not even 'pan fried' as the dish should be. It just seemed like cold noodles boiled and gravy poured over it. The bill came up to 1000 INR. The service was okay but the food was not worth the money.

As the restaurant says, it's a date with not only with your near and dear ones but also with yourself. Coming to the food they serve exquisite foods starting from starter to dessert. Mocktails too deserve special mention. Must try ""Sex in Africa"" and ""Date with me"". The kebabs that we had were so succulent and well cooked. Ghunzao chicken is best of the lot. Ilish biriyani and dhakai pomfret, perfect lunch combo you can take. Mughlai sartaj sabji is another must try dish you can have there. It's a three layered dry curry and you can team it up well with kabuli nan. Fried ice cream for dessert is not a bad choice. Overall my experience was pretty good there and I would love to visit soon for some more yummy dishes.",positive

We did not have much variety to choose from for Veg Main course, so we ordered Oriental Vegetables in white sauce, and it turned out to be really bad. The singaporeÂ  chicken was spicy and tasty.

I looked online browsing through rolls and cakes and everything else but it was evening and I thought why not a paratha!! Came here after some considerate selection I went for Paneer Paratha and when it arrived it looked mouth watering with aroma of ghee all around my cubicle(since I was at work). And when I had the first bite it melted in my mouth. A paratha as soft as a pastry.. wow!!
I had the whole of it in a few bites and I was full up to the brim. The taste was unique and something which lingers in your mouth for long after you had it..
Will have it again again and again.
Loved it!!!",positive
4297,"Mumbai Local as the name says it specialises in the street food of Mumbai, also serves North Indian and Chinese Cuisine. It is a theme based place on the local trains of Mumabai. The  mouth watering food out here will make you forget your cravings for non veg food incase you feel it is a waste to be in a pure Veg restaurant. You may completely binge on items like Chanachur paratha, Takatak Chilli Potato, Dhasu Dabeli, Chinese Samosas, Vada Pav , Kabab Platter and more.
The food presentation will leave you spell bound for sure. Many people go for indulging in these food items for dinner rather than going for the regular main course served here like Malai KolftaAloo do Pyaza, Mongolian Noodles. Rest you can be sorted with Chowpaty Gola barood, Strawberry shake, Margaritas of different falvour too.

Naan, mix veg and salad. Food was horrible to say least. I was really hoping for good taste because there were so fine review on zomato about the restaurant.
Naan was huge it was well made and chewable. Mix vegetable doesn't looked like mix veg. It was just lot of thick gravy with these thin shredded vegetable. I don't know if that's what they called mix veg because I certainly don't..

The pizza was excellent. From crust to toppings, everything was perfect. It is a great combination of Italian and indian cuisine. We were very satisfied with the quantity and quality. A must try item.

The decor is lovely so is the food. We ordered 5 dishes, out of which the chicken bao and veg fried rice with malayasian chicken curry is worth a mention. The curry was seasoned well and together with the paired accompaniments the meal elevated to a heaven of flavours. The cheesecake was but crumbly and not as light as I expected it to be but the icecream did taste heavenly. I would definitely go again. A word of caution avoid the dimsums the wrap was really doughy though the filling was flavourfull.",positive

We opted for the ashtami buffet..we had to wait for a while but it was worth it. The food was really awesome..for starters they had gondhoraj chicken, bhetki rolls, mourola macher bora. Gondhoraj chicken was average but mourala macher bora and bhetki rolls were really good. The welcome drink (gondhoraj ghol) too was refreshing. From the buffet what we most liked was the bengali menu of koraishutir kochuri, chhanar dalna and labra. The mutton Biryani was lip-smacking. The chicken lonka and mutton dakbungalow were also good. Also, they had a nice range of salads which was good.

It's very rare to see such good and such quick service. The food and drink was just too good and the ambiance was pretty eventful.
I would definitely recommend the Margherita pizza, the veg quesadilla(on Amit's recommendation) and the JalapeÃ±o pineapple dim sum. The latter is something that you would definitely be intrigued by. All in all an awesome experience.

Main Course
We ordered the Special Dal Tadka and the Aloo Do Pyaza with some Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. The Daal was made very well with some great flavours which paired very well with the Crisp Tandoori Roti. The Aloo Do Pyaza was quite different as it was topped with some fried onions which elevated the side dish to a whole new level. We understood why its one of their signatures and cleaned out the plate for this one along with some greasy(but tasty) Butter Naan.

The food was great and delicious, the staff professional and par time.
Ordered sweet and sour pork along with chicken fooyung or chicken omlette and the food didn't dissappointed me.
Though the ketchep used in pork is more then needed making it a bit sweeter then necessary which is the only difference I found in the traditional pork and it. The fooyung was made early and served with the pork making it a bit cold but that didn't diminish the taste.",positive

I just loved it.. sambar and chutney were also good.. filter coffee was very refreshing.. then we ate langcha and rosogolla from their sweet section.. mysore paak was out of stock.. overall I really liked this place and definitely recommend to everyone.. ð,positive

4035,"Last Sunday, I along with one of my friend went to this multi cuisine restaurant for dinner.We took one lemon crush,one virgin mojito,one plane naan and two Chinese combos- one was chicken fried rice with chicken manchurian and another was chicken hakka chowmin with chilli chicken.
All the five items costs 1142 INR in total(including tax).
Service and ambience were pretty good.
Quality and taste of the food were really very good.
Two things for cutting the rate- Taste of Virgin mojito was not as expected and quantity of the food was a little less in relation to the price.
Otherwise for the taste and quality,would like to visit again.",positive

An extremely courteous management visits each table to get real time feedback from their patrons. At last, now we have a Chinatown in New Town!

What we had : Masala Kulcha, Chicken tikka butter masala, butter nun.
Masala Kulcha (4.5/5): Hands down one of the best I have had till date. It had a sumptuous amount of masala filling and tasted downright delicious.
Chicken tikka butter masala (4.5/5): The gravy was lip smacking! Chicken pieces could have been a bit bigger though. Went really well with the kulcha and nun.
Butter nun(4/5): Though there was not much butter, it was extremely soft and quantity wise was remarkably good.",positive

After completing the platter we ordered Chicken Tandoori along with Butter Naan to satisfy our continued meat carvings.

We had their Crispy Chilli Babycorn that was really tasty. Their corn pepper salt was also well seasoned and had a nice light crunch to it. Recommend ordering their Murg Malai Kebab if you like soft and succulent chicken :)

The staff.s, cook and food quality used to be very good and tatsy initially. I use to frequently have momo, chicken chowmein, moghlai paratha from there and my favourite was chicken lollipop. They use to make awesome chicken lollipop. But later on with time passing by, with lack of proper maintenance and management, everything has been degraded.

But, still expected a lot from this place. They also limit their Menu on Pujo days.

We Ordered, Mixed Fried Rice, Manchurian Chicken And Chilli Pork. The rice was unboiled and some vegetables were unboiled too. Both the chicken and pork gravy looked same, and it was really difficult to identify both the dishes. The gravy was filled with soya sauce and literally looked like a sea.

Called into the restaurant after in the queue for an hour at least. Half an hour later, food order still has not been taken.

Half of the staff out for break. Owner is no where to be found. The manager's presence is negligible. The ruckus inside is visible with at least 3 customers waiting for someone to take their food order.

Also amongst the starters were a variety of Kababs and some lovely sushi.

The desserts section was a dream come true..... especially for those with a sweet tooth. In the end Cafe Swiss does indeed spoil one with a plethora of dishes.

I don't think it's a really good place to visit for the vegetarians, we couldn't drink water from the glass as it had some smell (probably something non-veg).

Low quality packaging is to be blamed for both. Taste was also not good, crust was hard and far from what a pizza of such cost tastes like. To add to it there was simply no visual appeal. I'm sure these problems are quite solvable and once solved, the Pizza Kingdom can indeed create the Royal Taste of Italyâº",negative

Alfredo pasta, veg chilli garlic noodles, meat monster pizza, Chicken stake sizzler (must have), Chicken Kasa, veg pulao, Lava cake with ice cream was fantastic.

The kebabs were also nicely done. In the main course I tried the paella with a white chicken gravy item, the paella, a variant of the original version, was good. The main star for me in the main course was the crab curry, it was outstanding. The let down for me was the dessert section, specially the chumchum was not at all of good quality, it was very course, not the smooth-passing down your throat thing that we are used to. The only savior in desert section was the four variant of ice-cream, the baked boondi also did not taste good. I would really like to request the management to up their desert section.

Yes I think I can. I ordered one chicken biryani from this shop and it got delivered in a container along with some salad. The taste was pretty good as expected as per the price the quantity is also moderate for a normal person or a foodie like me. The only thing I didn't like the rice quality as they don't serve with basmati rice a normal rice is used by them, other than that a big chunk of potato is given with a big piece of chicken. I liked it and I can suggest that go for it and try it. #BiryaniLove #Biryaniwala #FoodLove #Foodie",positive

Pocket pinch : Veg F.R.-55, which is really reasonable. Chilli Chicken-135.I think this price could be a bit moderate.
Taste : Both quantity and quality of rice was really good.I loved it. But the chicken was spicier than regular.The quantity of chilli needs to be lesser.

1.Mutton were little stiff. Not at all melting in the mouth kind of a quality. 
2. Quality of Rice could had been much better. Felt little bit dry.

Now something about the food,
They made such a delightful Biryani at this festival too. But all were not available, but they serve quite range of them.
It was a pleasure to being there. They serve Tikka Biryani, Hyderabadi Biryani, kachhi biryani, special chicken biryani.
All of were having an awesome essence of aroma of there genre.
With all I request aliah restaurant to celebrate this festival again",positive

3720,"Thanks to my friend for suggesting this place. Honestly i was apprehensive initially. My friend insisted on trying out this place. Though I am not too sure about the food. But I can assure you that if not the cheapest it is one of the cheapest places in south Kolkata for alcohol. If you are short on some bucks then go and try out this place. Now the two important things that you should know(if you are a first timer)---1. You have to make a membership card for â¹150 which will be valid for one year (without which alcohol will not be served to you) 2. You have to be an adult.
Doesn't matter if you are alone or in a group you will need just one membership card.
Service is decent.

I had ordered garlic naan, kofta and watermelon juice. Naan was simply amazing and was the kofta. I was slightly disappointed with the juice though as it lacked the taste of watermelon and the only taste coming was of soda and lemon. 
Overall, a real good experience and would love to come back to this place.",positive

And this place did not disappoint ..!!
A small eatery outside Malancha Bengal DCL, It has been 3 days since they opened.
Our first time here, we ordered chicken Malabar fry(12pc) and malabar mutton curry, for parcel.
Both were amazing dishes.
Chicken was fresh, crispy and well coated. The mutton curry was just perfect. Mutton was perfectly cooked. And the curry tasted delicious. They maintained the authenticity of Malabar cuisine to the point.
To sum it up, this was my first of many visits here :)
Food - 5/5
Packaging - 5/5

Note : Malabar cuisine dishes are normally quite spicy. Their normal spicy may be very spicy for some people.",positive

In puja not having a bengali food will not fullfill your pujo days. So trying out authentic bengali food will always be in the top list. This pujo i tried out bengali food from a new place.
The place is located at hotel celesta, baguihati bigbazar.
Ambience is really nice, decent you can say.
They serve buffet which cost rs 849, which includes starter like mochar chop to biriyani to illish and to dessert and lot more.
Some items really tastes nice but not all. The presentation of the food is really good and also some items really good in taste.
According to the price they are serving a lot more items and it is satisfactory for every one.
Overall a good experience.

Exotic Veg Pizza: The pizza was really good. The crust was fluffy and light and unlike any crust I have had yet. The cheese was also in a good amount.

Steamed Dimsum: The dimsums were too much flour and too little stuffing. Although I really loved the dips and the ginger garlic soup served along with them.

I found the staff a bit confused. And they took a really long time for a really small order. But the food was good. I expect better service next time.",positive

Perhaps they don't know how garlic chicken tastes cz they served a dish which tasted more of sweet and sour chicken rather than garlic chicken but since the taste wasn't bad we didn't complain. They shouldn't advertise something which they can't provide, for example they wrote free WiFi but there wasn't any, they wrote they accept all types of cards but they take only cash.

Loved the chef's special chicken - tender & juicy chicken pieces with the right dressing & sides. Pasta here is also nice. Lamb bolognese was a miss for me though (too much sweetness in the sauce).

7907,"The restaurant is pretty bad when you look at it from outside, and you are even more disappointed when you step in as the restaurant is completely vegetarian. The owners don't bother to keep much staff here as the restaurant is mostly empty and the costs have risen in the past few months which has even stopped the college crowd and the students in the nearby PG's to come and have a meal. They prefer Fatso which offers more variety or even Blossom which has somewhat the same price but offer varieties.
However, if you are a vegetarian who wants to stay away from non-veg as much as possible, this is the place for you. The Butter Naan with the Palak Paneer was delicious, and I didn't order much, so I don't have much to say about otherÂ items. However, I will pay a visit again in some time to try a few other dishes as you never know what suits your mouth.

Well, once I got it delivered to my place, it was not like any other similar combo that you might have had. The chicken in the burger was a complete waste and was not soft at all. It was not soft or juicy, but was completely course and tasteless. Well, I thought might be the French fries would have something better in store.

Coming to food, We had Mutton Biriyani(3.5/5), Chicken Kadai(2/5), Naan(2.5/5).
Biriyani had a large chunk of mutton with mostly meat and a small piece of bone. Mutton was melt-in-mouth soft but the potato was a bit hard in the middle.
Chicken Kadai had a intense hint of capsicum flavour and large piece of onions.

Overall, although they have a reasonable price tag on the menu but taste wise they were not that good.",negative

3599,"The place is not very old but has gain popularity as the liquor prices are cheapest in Sector 5. We visited on a weekend, the place was full. It's a huge open hall with tables and sofas. Once you enter it's the cacophony all around which is the first thing you notice.

Now coming to our experience, it was one of the worst. We got our table and waited 15mins just to get it cleaned. Once that was taken care, our next mission was to get hold of a waiter to get the menu and place the order. It took another 15mins tondo that. Then came the next challenge, having the food and the drinks served which took another 20mins. Looking at their service we only ordered a tandoori chicken even that took ages to come and that too partially cold. Even it took another 15mins to get the bill settled.

Food is very basic stuff, service is out of this world as they are very much understaffed. So on the month end when u r frustrated with ur job and are low on cash, this is the place u want to be in. ð",negative
9038,Worst restuarant I have ever visited. Located at syambazar crossing . I ordered hot & sour soup Hakka noodles and human chicken. The soup was a disaster smell of soya sauce all around . The noodles was like a roadside stall chowmein . And the hunan chicken was actually a chilly chicken . They don't even know the courtesy how to attend customers and they don't even have any softdrinks . They are just fooling people this restaurant should be closed immediately.,negative

Hariyali kebabs were soft, Succulent, juicy and quite big but lacked that taste.

Chutney/Dhaniya raita along with it is a disappointment though. It lacks the subtlety of how it should've been and that's one basic mistake one should not make. You won't find yourself asking for the chutney as you would at other prime Muglai restaurants in city.

Hong Kong Noodles too needs special mention, as this also own my heart. Loved the taste. But I would've been preferred more, if it would have been less oily. The quantity was enough for two.

We had grilled chicken skewers served in small glasses with barbeque sauce . The chicken was soft and juicy. Then we had fish and chips- tender basafish  fillet marinated and batter fried and served with mashed peas and fries. Then we ordered their thin crust pizza- texas stand off, made with chicken sausages, minced meat and mozzarella cheese. Very tasty and filling it was.

I have been ordering this veg thali for almost every day now.. And i havent been disappointed even once. Infact i am surprised at how good the food is at such low price. At just rs.70 you get a good amount of rice, along with dal, sabji, dhania chutney, paneer and a sweet dish.
Also the owner is really sweet and polite. Because this one time i called her up and asked to send me full rice instead of roti and rice, and she happily agreed.

1526,"Im shocked how they call themselves a ""Bengali Restaurant"" without having aloo posto or postor bora in their menu.
They have a very fixed menu lacking most of the Bengali delicacies and successfully ruined my Saturday afternoon lunch.
The lentil curry (dal) was cool as ice, even though we had our food at 1 pm.
The mutton curry was the worst I had in my life. It cost us 170 bucks but what they served was three cold tiny pieces of bone.
The bhetki paturi being a bit warm was still better than the rest.
Altogether it was a complete disaster and I would recommend to try Bengali food at some other food joints. Don't waste your money on cold food!

1205,"Very pretty place with lovely turquoise blue coloured walls, huge antique old windows , decorated with plants and paintings, also has a bookself loaded with books.

We ordered Flat White coffee,Hazelnut Cappuccino and Dark Chocolate Zucchini Bread to go with it. In food we ordered Hot Chicken Sandwich (which they gave as a burger just because we wanted a non-veg burger) and Pad Thai noodles with shrimp.

Flat white coffee was perfect if you dislike foam in your coffee. Hazelnut Cappuccino was good with a nutty flavor. I was really amazed with the Dark Chocolate Zucchini Bread (gluten free). It tasted like a normal chocolate cake (really want the recipe now!)

Hot Chicken Burger was yummy with thick juicy fried chicken patty and veggies like onion, lettuce and tomato and of course melted cheese. Pad Thai noodles was tangy and lemongrass , roasted garlic and other amazing flavors.

Also known as Bhupendra Mansion after the building it is housed in, i have been visiting this place for over 2 decades now and it still has the same taste. Its a favourite among morning walkers for breakfast but you can go here at lunch or dinner time and it would still be the same. 
It is not a very large space and is mostly quite busy but worth the wait if you have to stand in queue. 
You may think that the menu is not very elaborate but most things on the menu are worth trying. I personally love their sambhar. Weâve tried most stuff on the menu but our repeat orders are
~Paper Masala Dosa
~Sambhar Vada
~Idly with special chutney

When I say authentic I mean the very notion of it, starting from the set up to ambience to live Bengali music and not to forget the main part, food itself! Bhoomi at the Vedic Village Spa and Resort will leave you wanting you for more and more. The veg thali costs 1299/- + taxes and the Non veg one costs 1499/- + taxes, but when compared to the experience that you get, itâs totally worth every money.

Next day I again ordered Sweet corn soup with chicken fried rice, chilly chicken and dragon chicken.
This time I was a bit disappointed. The fried rice was out of the world but the chicken dishes were blunder. The chilly chicken was different with a whitish gravy which I liked but the chicken pieces were fibrous hard and not fried. The Dragon chicken which I expected to be a starter came with gravy. Though I liked the gravy but again the chicken pieces gave tough fight to my denture. But  I will visit soon and try some of their other dishes.",positive

Normally when a restaurant is giving a discount or an item is on offer we can't expect the quality to be the same as it on full cost. However I was taken aback when my notion was busted with their quality. I ordered a chicken roll via food panda at just â¹ 19 and it was fantastic. Today I ordered a full on meal consisting of lachha paratha , egg kasha and biriyani. The parathas were soft and not at a all chewy. The egg kasha was mind blowing. The biriyani could have been better. However overall my meal was a satisfying one and well worth the price . Food was well packed. Taste was on point and it was served hot. I would love to order again and definitely going to try our other items!

I loved their service. Although they took some time more than the estimated time of delivery but it's ok. The chicken in devil sauce was awesome. The Cantonese noodles was great. Both the rice were tasty nd tasted different from each other. So all in all loved this place. Next day they even call me to take the review of the foods. Loved this gesture.

The quantity is pretty good and from the taste point of view - A Big Thumb's up. A good place to dine in within normal budget.

Crispy Chicken -

Tasted good and I liked the way they garnished the dish. Chicken was soft and was less spicy with a taste of tangy sauce.

Mix Fried Rice -

It contained prawns, egg and normal veggies. Exotic chinese taste with balanced contents.

Garlic Chicken -

Chicken was soft and pcs were big. The gravy was tasty and not much spicy.

A small drawback is that few chicken dishes have similar kind of taste which needs to be improved otherwise it is a recommended place for chinese speciality.",positive

Tried a #CHILLIMANGOLITCHI mocktail - loved it especially the perfect blend of the flavours..

The #ChickenKeema & #ChickenManchurian samosas were superb.. They also have egg & prawn samosas as well..

But for me the pick of the day was the dessert version of their samosas - #MALAIMAARKE is simply a mindblowing fusion to say the least - samosas are stuffed with #Gulabjamun & served hot garnished with #Rabri - yummilicious..

Unique fast food delicacies are available indeed at this joint - should go viral soon..

4915,"3.9/5 to be precise.
Their biryani is actually TASTY. I've tried their egg biryani, chicken tikka butter masala and raita.
All the 3 were equally good. The biryani was moist, not over-spicy, light and very tasty. All in all, a perfect biryani. The chicken pieces in the butter masala recipe were pretty succulent. The raita added a kick to the meal.
Their packaging is also commendable. Also, the food is healthy- they don't use dalda or any artificial colours.
Definitely an option if one is looking for some really good biryani.",positive
3128,"Good ambience. Good service . We took chicken drumsticks as the starters and it was too good. But the non veg American chop suey was so sweet in taste. I'm not gonna prefer it. But the taste of the keema kulcua was yum. I simply liked it. The chicken rury curry was also too good.
Now comes to the desert. We ordered tuty fruity ice cream.. it was Fab ððð.

7261,"It is a worth try for any fish lover. Commendable guts to serve only fish dishes and maintain its own. I was pleasantly surprised with most of their offerings. The Makhmali kabab (bhetki) is a house speciality and was a real treat. Special mention goes out to gondhoraj bhetki if white sauce doesn't scare you. The highlight of all the main dishes for me was the Booal kalia. If you care for dessert, the chocolate phidni is a must try. It is a place highly recommend. But have your alternate choices ready as they don't have all kinds of fishes available as listed in their menu. This was my only gripe. The service though was top notch and they sounded apologetic when we repeatedly met with disappointment as so many dishes we were asking for weren't available.",positive

Chilly Garlic Chicken: This was a perfect accompaniment with the noodles. The gravy wasn't too hot or spicy. And the chicken was cooked nicely.

2. After crossing the little foot bridge, you ll get to see beautiful swans . 

3. I even met Piston , a great dane and a cat .. one lounging over a sofa and the other on a chair .

Canât mention about the food here,as on both visits, I had chai . Will be visiting  next for the â keema bunâ as mentioned as one of the - top dishes people order. 


Didnât like :::

1.The road leading to the cafe is absolutely potholed ( leave monsoon) , and ofcourse drab.

It was already over 10 pm and few more people were in their seats. They took about 30 minutes to serve the food. And the moment we started having, the staff or the managers started coming in one at a time and asked us to hurry up as they would close by 11 pm. But by the third call, we had lost it. We asked them if you weren't sure to serve and get us to depart by 1 hour why did you not tell us earlier so?

From the plethora of dishes, I restricted myself to Awadhi mutton biriyani accompanied by salan. Now, Hyderabadi biriyani does have salan as accompaniment but Awadhi? The biriyani was good and so was the salan. A new combination, rating of 4.5 is well deserved. I had a dish of fish but did not like the taste. So, 1 out of 5 there. The live counters of veg and non veg, especially for Kebabs were missing the chef. Was not able to taste them at 10:55 pm.

If there's one iconic dish that is most representative of Jimmy's, it is the Chilli Chicken, IMO. A couple of plates of these were ordered as starters and a long forgotten taste sensation reawakened. Simply stated, it was far and away the best chilli chicken I had tasted in a long, long time.

The Mixed Hakka Chow that came with Sweet and Sour Chicken next however, had way too much dark soya sauce and sort of broke the spell that the Chilli Chicken had woven. The Sweet and Sour was quite toothsome, though.

Next was the turn of the Mixed Gravy Chow, paired with Roast Chilli Pork. The Chow was okayish. Suffice to say, I've had better, elsewhere. The pork was well made certainly. I wish the meat had been less lean and chewy and the fat element, a little more.",negative

A friend of mine had suggested that Balwant Singh's eating house was just the spot to come to late at night to battle the cold with some hot chai so go there we did. :)

The kulhadi chai is just amazing! Personally, I would recommend the sweet version because it brings out the taste of the tea and gives you the kick that you expect out of the chai. 

The doodh cola was really good! I hadn't had something of that sort before so my experience trying the drink for the first time was quite enjoyable! :) It's the perfect blend of full cream milk floating comfortably over half a cup of thumbs up/coke. The best part about this drink is that it tastes like it's been ice-blended so even if you aren't a big fan of milk, you'll never know the difference because of how natural the combo tastes!",positive

Kun pao chicken was tasty but the shredded chicken was not upto the mark.. the quantities are huge. But quality was not that good. We orderd 2 plates of fried rice for 3 people . We had not even finished the 2 plates becoz of its bad taste.
Total cost came out - 614 including gst
Not a good experience . Specially Fried rice is a big NO",negative
6314,"Had been to this place almost two weeks ago. It's located in Dhakuria just opposite a petrol pump, before the flyover to Gariahat.
At the beginning, we were served papad as complementary. We ordered Chicken Drums of Heaven, Butter Nan, Dal Makhani and Chicken Bharta. Drums of heaven had 6 pieces and was delicious and very spicy. It was the only saviour that day. Butter Nan was not prepared properly. It was uneven -very thick in certain areas and overtly crispy sometimes. Dal Makhani was average. I have had much better ones elsewhere. Chicken Bharta had shredded chicken and an egg. It wasn't upto the mark too. The pieces weren't fresh. Quantity was okay for two.
Ambience is average. Service is fine. Our bill amounted to â¹756. Don't think I would be visiting this place again.",negative
7598,"Aamar Bangla Restaurant is a purely Bengali Cuisine Restaurant, especially for Bengali food lovers. We checked in for the first time in their restaurant and the restaurant is located in kestopur, rabindrapally. We ordered Basanti Pulao and Chicken Kasha. The Basanti Pulao was perfectly cooked and the yellow colour was too much attracting. Coming to the taste its tasted quite nice but a bit more sweet it was. The chicken kosha was more than perfect in it's taste. Can be perfectly paired up with this sweet Basanti Pulao. The quantity was sufficient for two people. Price is also reasonable. Ambience was suitable for everyone and clean and beautiful.â¤ï¸ð",negative

Quantity was really good and sufficient.",positive
9095,This place is situated near Indra Roy Road . From the name itself you may get the idea that it is a place where you can hunt for some good paranthas and it's true they serve quite a good variety of them ranging from Aloo Parantha to Cheese and Paneer Paranthas. But what bothers me is that the stuffings of the Paranthas does not taste good at all. The staffs are not at all bothered and I think they should improve the quality of food they serve. The seating capacity is descent but then the quality of food and gesture of staffs is what they are really lacking in. The prices are very much reasonable but then once they served me tea in a cup which was the most smallest possible plastic cup that can be found in the market and then charged me 25 bucks for such ridiculing preparation of an ordinary milk tea in that small cup which I felt was not at all worth it.,negative
1678,"Located in posh area of southern avenue where you see restaurants and cafes everywhere and standing as an unique with unique menu is very impressive.

Today we tried juicy minced chicken and exotic vegetables salad with plum dressing, melting cheese stuffed mushrooms, grilled pork chop, chocolate salami with chocolate mousse and ginger blast mocktail.

A must try. One of the best in town. Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

Quality of food is undoubtedly superb and seating arrangement is done perfectly looking after introvert, ambivert and extrovert people so that they can choose where to seat and enjoy their time with loved ones.

Thank you Hola for such delicious food and cozy atmosphere.

I find the interiors nice here, but my main problem here is, the hygiene. The glasses were not clean and I had to ask the staff to change the glasses, the service is something that can be worked upon to, by service I mean here the time they take to serve a dish, also when I ordered a few dishes they said it is not ready as it is early our of the day, these are the little things that can be worked upon.

I've ordered normal Kolkata Chicken biryani as well as the Hyderabadi one. Both of them are good. It's really hard to find Hyderabadi Biryani in Kolkata but I appreciate the efforts of this restaurant to make Hyderabadi biryani in Kolkata because Calcuttan are very particular about their biryani and the aloo in it. To make a biryani without aloo in Kolkata needs a lot of courage. Kudos to Biryanne and more. Although it's different from Hyderabadi Biryani but it tastes really good, rice spices and 2 pieces of chicken and 1 egg.

After quiting my job 2 years ago I went back to visit my ex-colleagues and before heading back I went to have my favorite spinach and corn vada pav with extra cheese. However, the menu have completely changed and none of the new names impressed me enough. I ordered a hariali corn vada pav and it wasn't even close to the vada pavs I once used to have everyday. Imagine the disappointment. All I know is that if I'm visiting sector v for some work ever again, I won't be grabbing a bite from this place.

7809,"This happens to be a Chinese takeaway food joint, located near Acropolis mall.
They have excellent packaging including condiments.
However, the food though tasty, is way too oily.

I tried the Chicken and Shrimp Hakka Chowmein. The taste is overpowered by the strong oil content. Also, the prawns were over boiled, and lacked out on the slight subtle crispiness.
Taste: 3/5
Pocket Pinch: 130 bucks.

Moving on to the Hot Garlic Chicken, the concentration of the ingredients to the oil was negligible. The dish had oil floating all over, in addition to being way too chilly for Chinese standards.This needs way too much of improvement, and the dishes need improvement on their oil content all together.
Taste: 2/5
pocket pinch: 140 bucks.",negative

Beverages.
1. Kiwi
2. Orange
3. Alphonso mango
4. Crazy Blue

combination of very good quality fish, properly prepared batter and exact frying in oil.The egg fried rice also had a unique taste which was further enhanced by the perfect balancing of sugar,salt,spice and oil.

I was expecting more professional staff.....maybe explaining about destinations reached and about Bengali culture...etc. Since we took the Dinner slot ...could not see much view outside too.

Next we ordered for mixed chowmein and a chicken dish the name of which unfortunately i am unable to recall. The noodles tasted good but the chicken was very average and not worth the order.

Quality- The quality of the food was really good, as we thought that it might not be as hygienic as it is locatedÂ in that sort of a small lane but it proved us wrong.Â 

Price- From the price point of view it is Reasonable,

Experience- It might seem that the shop is not located in a very good place but try givingÂ it a visit and I am pretty sure that it will prove you wrong. And definitelyÂ try the chicken stew as it is reallyÂ popular and delicious.

Firstly the decorations of this place is just amazing,and the ambience is so soothing

J.M.B.C--Please try , it's mouthemelting and the Smokey flavor is justâ¤ï¸.

Mahi chandi tikka- it is good as well.

TST special pork biriyani-- the quantity is not so much and the pork is so dry and the piece is so tiny

Luchnowi dum biriyani- same as above biriyani",negative

It's close to my college, so we have been there several times and we loved the place each time we've been there. The food is equally good. Pocket pinch is very student friendly and you get ample good food at a affordable price. Also the service is quick, neat and the staffs are so friendly. They ask for honest feedback as well after the service.
I am not too fond of Chinese cuisine but this place made me reach out to chinese food and love it only more everytime.
Great vibe and great company is all you need, isn't it?
Cheers to this amazing place! â¤",positive
8434,"This time I tried food here in Diamond Plaza Mall and ordered Garlic Chicken Combo. I can say the food is not overpriced here. They provide multi cuisine A la carte and combo options to choose from.

The rice was good and much oily. As it was a veg rice, so few veggies were present. Taste was very simple (nothing like chinese flavors) and kind of pulao. Quantity was good.

4 pcs of chicken were given (not so big) and were soft. The sauce was little bit sweeter but tasted good with rice.

Along with this combo, salad and french fries were given. The service was good. This outlet provide food in somewhat within budget and the taste is also good. One must try here atleast for once.",positive

6874,"Keeping the review crisp and short, since there is nothing much to write about it.Â 

Â  Â Basically it is a roadside food outlet as you have seen them throughout Kolkata. On a night, we decided to have a try from this joint through the Zomato Online Delivery. Since we had not much expectations, we had ordered to simple and well known dishes, namely the Egg Chicken Noodles and Chilli Chicken.Â 

Â  Â It took around 30 mins for the order to be prepared and around 15 mins for the delivery by the Zomato guy. Since most of you have tasted the roadside noodles and chilli chicken once in your life, you will find the taste exactly same. The egg and chicken quantity in the noodles was good, and the chicken pieces in the chilli chicken was normal. Although the noodles tasted fine, the chilli chicken tasted was somewhat on the down side.Â 

Â  Â So overall, you can try the food here with normal expectations having roadside restaurant taste.

We also tried out Ilish jhal and Pabda jhal. The gravy of Ilish had a bit too much of oil, but the quality of the fish was again top notch. And the same has to said about the pabda as well.

5300,"Location: Near Webel Bhawan, Sector 5.

I ordered the Egg Double Chicken Cheese Roll. To begin with, I would have definitely liked some more pieces of Chicken in my roll. The top portion had enough big chunks, but as I went downwards, the size kept decreasing and the last 2 bites didn't have any Chicken pieces. Size of the roll is great. Wonderfully oil fried Lachha Paratha used to prepare the roll. Cheese portion could be more generous.

Price, I thought is slightly on the higher side. I paid 101/- for the roll, which I thought should have been priced around 80 bucks.

I tried to pay the amount through card. The person at the counter lied blatantly and said they don't have card option. However unfortunately for him I could locate the card swiping machine and requested him to use it as I wasn't carrying cash on me. He lied again and said that they don't accept card below orders of 300, which I found quite unbelievable. They need to get rid of this reluctance towards card payments.",negative

On one of the rainy evenings , I was craving for some tasty and spicy food. From zomato I found out this place and placed my order.

I ordered chicken tangri , chicken tikka masala and tandoori roti.
I was surprised with the taste and the delivery was on time.
It was amazing.
I enjoyed every bite of it.
Moreover , it doesn't burn ur pocket much.
All I had to pay was Rs. 140 .

Now coming to the packaging, it was extremely poor. Can you imagine the gravy was packed along with the chicken, rice and chips together in a paper box. Everything got messed up when I opened the box and the gravy was leaking. Now the taste, i love spicy food (and that's why I ordered peri peri chicken) but no matter how much ever you adore spicy food, it is still difficult for your taste buds to tolerate a dish made with 100gms of pepper.

I threw away the entire food...And trust me it was not at all beef also...cause the beef is a bit red or blackish red, it can't be so pinkish...

and simple logic is, when mutton is 560 INR/Kgs in kolkata, how can someone sell 2pieces of mutton in just Rs.80

So, guys please be careful while ordering MUTTON...",negative

Also ordered their drums of heaven which was not that good. The sauce it was made on was a mixture of sweet and sour taste but there was no tinge of chicken but was filled with maximum batter stuffing. But I will keep ordering their gravy chowmein. Must try!

2)Re-ordered again : This time their chicken lollipop and ofcourse their gravy chowmein. Chicken Lollipops are better than drums of heaven. And this time the chowmein was more awesome than the previous time. With lots and lots of veggies, chicken , mushrooms and corns. Yumm!",negative

veg- â¹449+ tax
Non veg- â¹549+ tax

Main course- chicken biryani ,mutton kosha,and 2 chicken preparations
Loved their mutton kosha succulent soft pieces of mutton cooked in spicy gravy
Biryani was not upto the mark very bland in taste

Dessert-
Chocolate ice cream mouse cake
Gulab jamun
Firni
Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce- ice cream tasted very different like sugar free ice cream.

I dint find the food fresh and price of the drinks was on average side .. they do have happy hours menu on drinks but beer are not included there, I hope they include it soon..

Also, the last time we went during the pujas, we ordered burnt garlic rice, which never had even a hint of garlic in them.

The ambience is great along with large variety of board games. I didn't mind waiting for the food ( it did take some time) at all because I was having great fun playing Pictionary. The service overall is good.

We ordered the Fresh Tomato Pesto Pizza. Order this pizza only if you know you like pesto. The taste is quite strong and it took me a little while to appreciate the taste. That being said though, it's a good pizza.

I like the honesty of the place. They made the ambience in a way other cafes try but fail. They take their time with the pizza but the crust is good, the cheese is generous and the toppings are fresh ( although the pizza is a little small).

I'll definitely visit again and try other items from the menu. I hope to see proper eggless desserts by that time.",positive

Coming to the food, I ordered a chicken sandwich along with a brownie milkshake to start off. I found the milkshake really good as i could feel the brownie being properly grinded and mixed smoothly to give such a fine taste. The sandwich was good, although i felt it was missing something such as a coleslaw on the side or mayo inside the bread ; still was good. I then ordered an Affogato to finish it off. Originally given with a sciop of vanilla ice cream, due to unavailability of Vanilla ice cream, I was given a chocolate scoop which surprisingly tasted better.

Photo is attached of Mushroom and Paneer tikka what I ordered.
Taste was waste and quality was even not up to the standards , the guy who recommend me himself not satisfied with such delivery of hungrill .
It was not barbecued properly they just added masala over prepared paneer n mushroom and packed without barbecue. Taste was eating raw food.
Decided not to blow up our head and left the food and moved for airport with bad taste . In Kolkata restaurant serves good on tables but pathetic food on delivery , it's every where . I had experience this many times during my vacation.
Everywhere people are little hard minded they consider visiting offline customer as customer and online customer like stranger so they provide quality of taste and services to online orders",negative

Edit- I have re-rated them to reflect their perceived lousiness in dispatching orders. Encouraged by their previous delivery, I ordered 'Elahi veg thali'. They didn't pack chutney. Now if you do not have the attention span to pack all the items meticulously, why keep such an elaborate option? The thali costs 220 and chutney alone costs 50/-.

8313,"Went there with my family on a weekend evening, it is located at joka junction. Well decorated,very spacious and having courtetous staffs. Almost 100 people can be accomodated at a time easily. It has a separeted private dining area as well. Mood was good there, ac were working properly.
We gave the order of chicken hariyali kabaab. It was served hot,juicy inside and well garnished. Then we had chicken biriyani, mixed fried rice and lemin chicken. All the items were good. The biriyani need a special mention here, it was so tasty, less oily and served hot with raita.
At last we placed the order of sea water mocktail it was very close to a well known blue lagoon. The hot gulab jamun with ice cream was really good in taste.
Overall a well outing it was and would like to visit it again. The only flaw which i could mention is that they took around 20 mins to get the food ready, other than that all ok.",positive
7179,"I placed order at 9.41pm and received at 11.05pm. I thought food will be good as it was much awaited but literally I was disappointed. I ordered spicy Asian veg bao and padthai noodles from this outlet. When I saw the bao my expectations get herts as it came as a size of a single dumpling and cost Rs. 89/- each. I tried bao from lots of other restaurants but i never had such a small size like this. Also the quantity of padthai noodles was too less which just broke my heart. If anyone could suggest me a tagline for this restaurant on behalf of my expirence I would suggest ""Wastage of money and time"". If you have extra money and wondering where to waste then this restaurant is definitely made for you.",negative

901,"This is a good option for people interested in vegetarian food other than the staples that are tagged onto menus in restaurants better known for their fish and meat dishes. The thali system offers a wealth of options - if anything, there is too much food served to you. During our visit, we had to choose carefully in order to be able to take seconds of the things we liked most and not overeat. In particular, the alu-bhindi (a common dish not usually noted), a Rajasthani daal (which reminded me of kadhi), the daal-baati-churma, and a halwa with apples stood out among the rest. There was also an excellent garlic pickle on the side.

The service was good and the ambience quite pleasant. However, it might be a good idea to let diners know in advance the number of dishes that would be served, along with descriptions of the less familiar ones. Overall, I liked the place and would visit again.",positive

The starter was cooked to perfection. Honestly I loved the taste, however the pieces had hardly any flesh. But again it is WINGS.. so I understand..

The gravy noodles were fine as per my taste buds. But though it was mixed, we missed eggs, however chicken and pork pieces along with prawns (read shrimps) were there. When asked why egg is not there, the waiter mentioned they don't give eggs in the mixed items... I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LOGIC!!

Ordered their Veg Noodles & Chicken Manchurian combo for Rs. 89 only. The food was delivered super fast within few minutes in super hot condition.

Veg Noodles were made very authentic Chinese style with crunchy vegetables. Thick noodles tossed with very mild spices tasted very neutral.

Chicken Manchurian was spicy with thick gravy and coriander leaves on top for garnishing. 2 medium sized chicken pieces, tasted juicy and fresh with full of flavours.

I liked everything about this place except the quantity of Noodles. Noodles were delivered in a small foil pack unlike contains and quantity was very low. It can be managed as evening snack but definitely not for lunch or dinner.",positive

However, due to the lack of a proper dance floor barring the private party arena, people usually dont get into the groove. The quality of the drinks isn't that great and can be improved. The food quantity is a bit less but very tasty. The lasagna is great but less in amount and so is the pizza. However, the starters are just out of this world. I tried all the beers. None made a great impression. However the Martini was great. The 'Sex on the Beach' & 'Virgin Pinacolada' were pretty ordinary. P.S. Do request a song to the DJ",positive

I ordered :

Well the egg chicken fried rice and chilly chicken was superb to be honest, the combination was just perfect. Didn't liked the noodles that much as it was a bit on the oilier side, manchurian was average not as great as chilly chicken.

The delivery was on time but the packaging needs to be improved. Overall a good experience.

I had asked for Saturday shake for the variety of it, but the maÃ®tre de table looking at my condition, suggested saffron and almond milk. It was thick and wonderful to taste. It cooled me and at the same time rejuvenated me.
It was a different atmosphere. Almost a gurukul like feeling, the aroma of exotic spices add to its beauty. The books for reading consist mainly of classic books, self help books and books on yoga. The menucard looks like a monthly magazine. The menu predictably consist of healthy food excepting cold coffee with ice cream.
Price is moderate. Fee Parking available. There is also lift system.

7196,"Dissapointed.

It was Bhai- phota, so we brothers and sisters decided to have Biriyani, thus we ordered seven to eight packs of Biryani from A1 Haji, Baranagar, it was a great disappointment. The Biriyani rice, smelled awfully bad, the chicken pieces were also smelling badly, the potato was not boiled properly. It seemed that it was made a day or two before, and they served us that. Probably the Street Biryani Counters make much great biriyani than them. It extremely disappointed me, nobody could had their lunch that day.
And then when we went their to complain they refused to exchange. After arguing a bit, one of the staff said that they will exchange only two packs of Biriyani, we agreed on that too. But after coming back home, we realised that they gave us the same one by just serving it hot.

My opinion is that, take a bit extra money, but serve good food atleast.

Not at all recommended.",negative

Karthik took our order and served the drinks very quickly and he was very courteous and polite.",positive

The quantity and quality of the food was good. We had ordered crispy chilli babycorn for starters and chicken lemon and coriander soup. They tasted delicous, especially the soup was warming on a rainy day. Then we ordered a main course platter, the chicken stroganoff which was a plate full of vegetables, steamed rice and chicken and mushrooms tossed in wine. All this was more than enough food for the two of us and we were totally full. And all this came within 500 including taxes.",positive

Though this is a street side stall kind of an eatery, serves better food at reasonable price compared to the other restaurants in this locality.
Sitting is available but I usually takeaway as the sitting area is very small.
Coming to the food :Great kebabs and Good biriyani.

Edit: Staff seems to get cranky, if the place is over crowded.",positive

Would have loved to give a higher rating, if not for the inconvenience caused by the restaurant. They just cancelled my order (for apparently no reason) even after the Zomato valet confirmed about the same and asked me about my location. When it was quite a time, I checked my order and found it to be cancelled. Then I repeated my order (but unfortunately this time the promo code didn't get applied and I had to pay Rs 150 more). But atleast the Zomato chat support helped and credited 100 credits in my account for the hassle caused. I am not disappointed with Zomato but highly disappointed with Zaikebaaz for the trouble caused. Had they not cancelled the order, I would have had 150 rs off. The food is good, but I wish the service is improved.",negative

Went on a weekend was fully crowded as well as queue there, but still got the table quickly.
A restaurant can only stand out when there is a constant balance between quality and consistency.
And Cream center has justified the above mentioned category. The quality of food, courteous staff and warm hospitality speaks volumes about the brand.
It serves vegetarian cuisine in the city which is dominated by carnivores.
It serves mainly continental and north Indian cuisine, sizzlers as well as Bambaiya chaats.

The staff is courteous, however they messed up with our order and served us a starter meant for someone else. Although the starter was very tasty, neither did they apologize for this, nor did they offer to make it a complimentary dish, since it was entirely their mistake. The Smoked Chicken Pizza and the Pepperoni Pizza were great. Long Island Iced Tea is quite strong here with respect to other places, but its awesome. The Caipiroska was also great. There is a large screen for sports screening. The overall experience was good, barring the starter incident. The place is a bit dark inside, hence front flash is a must for selfie freaks.",negative

On a very unlucky day where they were out of Pork Items, mainly the ones I have heard so much about, I decided to have Chicken Bao, Grilled Bhetki, Dry Chilli Chicken and few other dishes paired with a glass of neat scotch. Both the fish and the chicken melted in my mouth and you could enjoy the royalty of a Kolkata Bhetki.

8670,"I know of this popular Hedua restaurant for many years but have never happened to dine here. So I chose this to treat a few new friends last evening.

The interior is modest but presentable with all sofa seating. Service staff is attired. I went for Chinese as this place is known for this cuisine. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken on the side. The portion size of the rice and noodles was good but the taste was average, so they didn't justify the prices. The side dish had twelve not-so-large pieces of chicken. The meat was chewy and the gravy a bit too hot though I had specified otherwise.

We rounded it off with ice cream. They had only one flavour- vanilla. So I asked to bring it with chocolate sauce poured over. They put some nuts too. It tasted good but a price of Rs 130 was quite a premium.

I won't be keen to come back.

Must Try:
- Lepchi Kai Chicken- their signature dish- huge chunks of succulent chickenÂ 

- Lemon Garlic Soup (choice of Chicken/Mixed/Veg): basically clear soup but with lots of gaflic and kafir lime. Perfect starter for a winter meal, or in case you are looking for some relief from the wheezing and cold congestion.

The paper dosa was much smaller than expected, also the waiter couldn't explain the differences between some dosa options
The uttapam was crunchy on both sides, I don't mind crunchy at all but the inside was still mushy as if in a hurry they had cooked at a very high temperature while the inside did not get cooked properly. It wasn't too bad but I don't expect my uttapam to melt and fall",negative

Masala Dosa & Lemon Rice @ Krijuss, Kolkata âº

Situated around the junction of Phool Bagan and Beliaghata, Krijuss is a recently opened vegetarian restaurant that serves - South Indian, Chinese and Sandwiches.

Being always on the lookout for good South Indian outlets, I parcelled Krijuss's Masala Dosa and Lemon Rice for tasting.

The Dosa came with the customary Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and Onion-Tomato Chutney.

The Masala Dosa was uniformly cooked without any burning around the edges and had enough Aloo Masala stuffing inside. The Onion-Tomato Chutney was fresh and tasted better than most of the other local South Indian eateries. The other two accompaniments were average. The entire dish tasted nice.

The Lemon Rice was infused with enough peanuts and curry leaves. It was well cooked and tasted good. The quantity parcelled was more than enough for one person.

Price of Masala Dosa: Rs. 90/-
Price of Lemon Rice: Rs. 70/-

Had scotch with Caesar salad and chicken wings. The wings were delicious and the Caesar salad was perfect.
Also had their thin crust Hawaiian pizza.Turned out its their specialty.The grilled chicken toppings were tender and juicy.The veggies were fresh and crunchy.Pineapple chunks gave it a citrus twist.
Nice experience.",positive
827,"Rated 4* because of the interior design, ambiance, bar counter, sitting decor. But if i talk about the food quality, quantity and taste they should work on it. Because i have had same dishes much more tastier in other places that too in a low budget. So i shouldn't say that there menu has got something different and excellent. Cocktails also like it was good but nothing exceptionally amazing. If you guys can upgrade the food menu, quality, quantity and taste then it will just go hand in hand with the rest of the qualities that i have mentioned above. I just loved the interior of this restaurant, dim light, good musiz, perfect for boozing.",positive
5060,"Last month me and colleague went to this restaurant which is very near to our office. Its mainly famous for Chinese cuisine and although now they have started serving North- Indian or Mughai dishes. Apart from that its having a bar which is a real plus point for those who want to take a drink along with good food.

Ambiance is very good. With great interior design and good seating arrangement.

We ordered Chicken biryani and Chicken tikka masala. Chicken biryani is very tasty and flavourfull although its slightly on richer side.
Chicken tikka butter masala also very yummy and spicy. The kebaab used in chicken tikka butter masala gravy was on decent side.
Overall had great lunch
Total bill for one chicken biryani, chicken tikka butter masala, one papad and two cold drinks was around â¹998/-",positive

3198,One of the best food joints for quick bites specially their rolls- unlike other places their rolls are not dipped into a kadai of oil. They are made of rumali roti and along with others stuffings they add mayonnaise which gives the item altogether a totally different and lipsmaking taste (a must try). Their other items are also delicious but I really didn't like their jungly biriyani- too oily and lots of chilies were used to make it spicey and less of actual spice was used.,positive
10455,Today I ordered roti and mushroom masala for my dinner from this outlet.after put an order I just called them immediately and requested for a good packaging. Then they asked about anything to customize it. After few minutes I called my delivery guy to to give the correct location details and o got my order with in 15mins. The food was delicious. The rotis were hot and soft and the mushroom is simply awesome in taste. Further I got a call from this people for the taste and quality. It is undoubtedly the best deal near by. This is my second order from this outlet and in future o am going to order many more. Appology for not uploading any pics as I was good damn hungry.,positive

Forgot the singer's name, but he had a lovely voice (a perfect 5 for him). Shifting to food, they had a huge spread (Chinese items were less). Bengali dishes and desserts were really delicious. My personal favourites were 'chingri cutlet', 'chanar curry', 'bhetki pur bhaja' but the 'chocolate pan' took my heart away. They were even gifting a special 'subha saradiya' cake to all the customers. A lovely gesture! #happytummydays",positive

Now I understand slow service if you have a full house but there was no one around except us . Maybe the Service guys had taken a napÂ  The masala vada was also not to my liking With all the wrong spices and almost cold and oily . I've had much better ones at various other south Indian food joints in the city. Aloo paratha was dry and The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing.

The seating area is very spacious and spread out quite well with couple seats (1+1) and others for groups and families. The decor is quite beautiful too with flowers and hand crafted designer lamps it makes it all the more beautiful.

The service is quite quick, the staff is polite, however some are still learning so they might need a repetition while you're ordering which isn't a big drawback.

The food quality is good. It tastes quite decent, it's not the best but it's not too bad either and a single dish or portion is enough for a person and sometimes even two people can share it and it's enough for two. The prices are pretty reasonable too, quite easy on the pocket. A lunch for two will be somewhere around 400 which is very reasonable.",positive

The entire food was served in two halves. for the first lot the kabiraji was absolutely yummy. the fresh lime was nice. the mutton was nicely cooked and the polao was also fresh. however for the next set. the mutton served tasted different. the curry was not similar to the earlier set. the fresh lime was not good. we saw lump of salt piled up at the bottom in each glass. overall the location is good. but taste and service needs to be improved a lot else after few years they wont exist in this competition.",negative

Aloo dum, which taste too good, it cooked with scrambled paneer and green peas. 
They also provide salad, green chilly chutney, one masala papad and raita.

If you are lucky enough, you could come across some tollywood star sharing the dancefloor with you. The security is very strict which you wont find in most of the clubs of kolkata. The ambience inside and the decor is incredible. The staffs too are cordial but it usually takes longer time than usual to get your order ready. This is one of the most happening clubs in Kolkata and due to great security you will also find that the crowd inside the club is also quite good.",positive

Just ordered 2 veg momo(6pcs each) via âzomato. They served soup also. They charged 5 rupees each for packaging but the packaging was very very normal just like the sweet shop packets.

It tastes just ewwwwwwðððð
TERRIBLEð­ð­
The veggies inside was raw,kachha bilkul

8599,"I love this small take-away counter at Beliaghata Joramandir. They call it HonKong Fried Chicken. HFC is a promising alternative to KFC, where we get crispy crunchy fried chicken, akin to the latter, at very low prices. Burgers are also very tasty, with a crunchy chicken patty between the bread. There is enough reason to come back for more!
The chicken is quite tender and juicy, the batter is a bit under-fried at times, else their items would be indifferentiable from KFC's.
Great job HFC!",positive
11098,"They ask for service charge when they don't even have staff. The food is not hot. They don't even serve cold drinks in glass, then how can they charge Rs 500 while we ourselves have to pour it in small glasses from the bottle. Had to serve them myself as they had requested me to help due to the shortage of Staff(do not help in restaurant, ever. They don't consider help). Overpriced. 
Can you see a jain menu. They charged 175 for Rs 155 sandwich(make it your sandwich without cheese)
And then they say 10%discount on service charge which is optional. I choose not to pay as it was a buffet which was again accepted because of shortage of staff. 
Totally dissatisfied with food and services and pricing.",negative

In frame :

Saucy Chicken wings

Popcorn Chicken

Well coming to the food... This is absolute value for money.. The burgers have their own signature style and extremely easy on the palette as well.. The saucy chicken is totally different with chicken wings doused in the house special sauce with garlic and schezwan infused flavours. Finally the popcorn chicken also does a neat job. The peri peri sauce is also not too spicy and goes well with the Indian foodie sentiments.Alsp the packaging is a big plus with cute doodles on the popcorn chicken boxes.Definitely a do not miss outlet...

They have expanded the area a bit since the last time I visited. It was more or less empty the few times I visited, but the food is satisfying enough.
I've tried their octopus, squid , pork, crab and pan fried chowmein which is okay and Indonesian rice which is good.
The squid in honey chili was very tasty although I'd have liked less batter.
Octopus is nice.
Pork is chewy and feels a little stale.
Crab is ok but not very meaty.

Weekdays dinner charges are 680 for veg and 780 for non veg including taxes. Service and ambience was great. Although they could add few more starters and also deserts to the buffet. Main course was decent. Although it's not at all better than the barbeque nation but in case you want to have great barbeque buffet at decent price then this is the place. But I still feel at this price they could have added few more starters and also improve the quality of the starters compared to other barbeque buffet restaurants.

Chicken Tandoori- Despite the proportion being good, the chicken was not ar all tender and succulent. The mint chutney was disappointing on it's part.

We also wanted to order Beer but they have certain rules regarding registrations in their club. Without a membership code of their club one is not allowed to order drinks.

Barring paneer chutkule, none were palatable, couldn't eat much of it and had to waste most of it.
We even had iced tea and sweet lime soda, which were a saving grace for this horrible lunch.

Recently I ordered the egg chicken rolls and found it very good . Only I would have liked a little more dash of lime in it.",positive

1779,"Sorry Bohemian, the new look, updation and food menu is just not going with the current scene. I was an impeccable fan follower of your place but your recent menus (thrashing all the previous menus) made me very sad. Not that it makes me sad it makes me angry because very few of those items can suit up with tastebuds of Calcuttans. 
The variations (except some of the signature cocktails) are just lame and not upto the mark! We have ordered the Bhetki paturi variation and the Mangsho Haari. Both were ordinary but Mangsho was quite horrible. However, the Daab Sangria was refreshing!

Please change it soon!",negative

6469,"Close to the shyama prasad mukherjee road and kalighat metro station previous to ccd, this place is a paradise for quality food lovers.

We ordered Nizami mutton biriyani and non veg kebab platter. Both were superb.

Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

Don't forget to use discount giving apps as you will save some money undoubtedly.

A must try. Staffs are very polite in nature and well behaved.

Thank you The Palms restaurant for the hospitality.

The food tastes amazing and they excel in all the cuisines that they serve. Chinese is a must try here. This place, infact, is my personal favourite. The interior is really pretty.

Thukpa, the yummilicious meal originates from Tibet and now is a popular dish of Nepal and Sikkim. It is a noodle soup , dashed in with scrumptious veggies which leaves a succulent, tangy aftertaste.
The place has colourful decor and courteous staff. But the food definitely stole the show .
It was my first time tasting thukpa and this warm main course delicacy will keep attracting me to this place.

Loved the dudhiya kabab and Mukund kabab. Loved the accompaniments. The paneer sabzi and Kali dal are prepared differently and are absolutely delicious. The highlight is the breads. All different types but so well made that you just want to keep eating. The only reason for the 4 rating is the biryani...it just wasn't good...and since its an Awadhi restaurant, it should have been excellent, but unfortunately it was a let down. So a must visit place, but biryani should be avoided.",positive

11221,"I am a patron of the Parsi cusine which happens to be very obscure in Calcutta. This is the only place in Calcutta that dishes up quintessential Parsi delicacies, considering the other caterer fails at maintaining authenticity & quality. I have been religiously having the Dhansaak for lunch on Sundays, since the last couple of years during my stay in Bombay and Poona. After moving back to Calcutta, this place manages to salvage me from withdrawal symptoms.

Their Mutton Dhansaak paired with Browned rice, topped with caramelised onions and the Lagan Nu Custard (a baked custard based dessert from the kitchens of Bawa Weddings), make for a sinful meal that's got me enslaved. Mrs. Meher Hansotia and her husband Dara Hansotia are always at their hospitality best. This makes for an unparalleled culinary experience inside an exquisite Parsi Dharamshala that's over a century old.

The decor is very good. It's quite busy place filled with people so tabel booking is must. Service is bit slow but the rush they have i consider that part.

But with years passing by and with competition getting stiffer, it may have lost its edge a bit. However, the food is still better than average. I remember coming here quite a few years back and then now very recently the experience seemed not so bad either as far as food is concerned. We had the Kakori kebab and the Paneer Kali Mirch Tikka for starters. Both of them were average. The Masala Handi Mutton Biriyani was different. It was more Pulao than Biriyani, howvere it tasted pretty good. The place might seem a bit small and the service is a bit late than one would prefer. Being one of the very old restaurants I personally want it to do well, but perhaps the food needs to improve a notch",negative

I ordered a Mixed Gravy Noodles, along with a Schezwan Chicken!
Quantity of both the dishes were really good as per the pricing.
The mixed gravy noodles was full of chicken and prawn, and tasted high quality, i was amazed at the quantity and quality from such a shop. Next the Schezwan Chicken was full of flavours, and tickled my taste bud! Hats off to the chef, he must be a great one! Looking forward to other famous dishes of this joint, namely the dragon chicken.",positive
248,"Was here for lunch on Christmas with family. The place was just about to shut down, however the manager was quite courteous and let us have a seat.

We quickly ordered for some starters that had beer battered tempura fish and Hong Shao Rou. The beer battered fish was exquisite! It was so tender and it tasted so well with the orange tartare ! The pork starter was tender and equally good!

For main course we had Lobster Thermidor which was a continental dish. The lobster was creamy and so damn delicious! We tried some Moon fan and chicken in oyster sauce next. Both the quantity and taste were impeccable!

As for drinks we ordered a virgin mojito, Chivas julep and the manager recommended a special bourbon cocktail for me which goes my the name Hitman! Hitman surely hit me with the taste and it'll would give you a good buzz with it's strong taste and flavor. Had a splendid time here and really enjoyed the food! Would visit this place again hopefully!",positive

They serve three bases-

1) Rice
2) Flat noodles
3) Hakka Noodles

After choosing the base, you get to choose Veg or Non-Veg. After that your preferred veggies, sauce and sprinkles. They will cook accordingly and your food will be ready!

â¶ï¸If you prefer sweet sauce then go for Spicy plum sauce and if you love spicy, then choose Volcano or Thai sauce. Kung Pao and Hunan sauces are moderately spicy.âï¸

Another big attraction of this restaurant is the mouth watering Tandoori Rolls for which one can quite often find a long queue at evenings.
Now coming to the foods,all the items come in good quantity and specially the tandoor dishes are exceptionally delicious.Their speciality is the Diana Kebabs,which not only taste good,but also is treat to the eyes.Yes,so colorful the burnt texture of the Chicken wings appear to be that no one can fail to notice that.

The Biryani was too dry and over smelled and the Chanp was very spicy and taste wise it was not so good. I have tried many tasty road side Biryanis priced under Rs. 80 but in this case my experience was really bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,negative
2121,"It is a relatively newly opened joint with an ecstatic ambience and decor. You'll be amazed right when you enter the place. The presentation of the food served is equally good and eye pleasing. But to my disappointment it only pleasing to eyes and not to the palate.
Pesto Pasta- This did not seem like I am eating a Pesto pasta. It tasted like a normal white sauce one. The taste was good but I expected more veggies.
Bhavnagri Cheese poppers- This was really nice. The stuffing was cheesy with a little spice in it.
Chinatown Style Chilly Paneer- This was not that good in taste. It was simply Cottage cheese wrapped in some Sauce.
I wanted to try their pizzas which was not available.

Dal machaan and olive chilli Naan are my absolute favourite here, hands down to that.
Pocket pinch is okay too, I mean câmon you get everything up to mark so you gotta pay too.

Coming to food. We ordered
1. Beer Batter Fish : This item I personally didn't like it. The item is over fried and that's why it losts it's taste.

2. Chicken cheese Lasagna: This item was amazing. Full of cheese and chicken served with Bread.

The Long island Ice tea was perfectly made.

Hookah was very smooth.

3490,"Being a resident of Airport Gate No 1 Area, I am one of the regular customer of this place. And most of the time, I loved it. But last day, the food was exceptionally brilliant.

I ordered Chicken Lollipop, Aalu Paratha, Lachcha Paratha, Daal Tadka and Butter Chicken.

Chicken Lollipop : Perfectly cooked chicken wings tossed in sauce mix. One of the best chicken lollipop among the delivery or take away joints of this area.

Lachcha Paratha : Not like those heavy - middle layer undercooked paratha like other places. This one was soft and can make a perfect duo with any side dish.

Butter Chicken : Your search for authentic Butter Chicken will stop here. Need to say more?

Rest of the items were okayish. Will love to order again.

Ordered the Filipino Style Fried Chicken Drums, accompanied with a lovely sweet and spicy chilli sauce.

The chicken drumsticks tasted fresh and appetising; the coating was crisp though a bit low in salt, which actually gave the chicken its authentic taste.
If one is fond of KFC then one would love gorging on the fried chicken drums from Funite, though the spicy zing of a KFC chicken leg is not guaranteed.

Itâs not just about the cuisines being served at these places but its also about how to present the food, the ambiance, the lighting, the mood that has been set and a host of other things. The quality of food has always been something that has been constant, but food has become a more integral part of hanging out and meeting people. So spaces or restaurants with places to hang out over good food and drinks are on top of everyoneâs list and add live Television and big screens to that list and I am all jazzed up and good to go. Second House, Bar, and Restaurant is one such place with all the things that it has to offer.

Most interestingly, they have over 130 items in the menu. And as a food- adventurous person, every time I visit the place, want to try different items but each and every time got stuck to Chowmin and Chilli Pork..

Come to this place, enjoy the hospitality, enjoy the food and also enjoy a bit of North Calcutta culture...

Been visiting this little eatery since childhood, they still have the same staff, same Ambience and same quality food
They serve pizzas, sandwiches, south Indian, and north indian
Their pizzas give a feeling of homemade pizzas with just the right amount of vegetables and cheese
The north indian thali is pure love
Served with variety of vegetables dal and raita
This is my all time favourite place.
The quality and quantity is perfect
The staff is polite
They have outdoor seating and is best to have dinner in a nice weather",positive

Once you go inside you will travel back to 70s. The unkempt look of the place and the visitors surely add to the vibe. We had a tea and cake, nothing special in modern standard.
Go there only for the nostalgia nothing else.",negative
8292,So dissapointed with the puja buffet. Everything was so ordinary. Starting from kebabs to main course. Bangalir heshel was costly and did not live up to the hype. Sweets were ordinary. Peas pulao was stale. Mutton was ok. Dissapointed with the spread and service.,negative
7711,"An addition to the seafood scene in the city. Bay Bay's is a great option for coastal cuisine which is delicious and affordable!! The interiors are nicely done and the theme is marine, going with the name of the place. It's quite cost, with soft music playing. I had the following:-
Chicken Hot Wings - Very good!! Just the right amount of spicy.
Chicken Lasagne - Cheesy and creamy with a good amount of filling.
Mutton Uppu Curry with fried rice - Must try dish from here... Spicy rich mutton gravy with very soft and delicious mutton pieces ðð
Mango Pannacota - Quite good ð
Ice cream sandwich- Ice cream between two big skices of brownie and slathered with chocolate sauce.
In a nutshell, Bay Bay's is doing white well for themselves. Cheers!!

We chose  fine dining experience with a la carte. We started with Mocktails like Moira street (fresh lime soda) and second one prepared from guava, chilli and spices and both were refreshingly cool. Then we had theirGondhoraj fried chicken - strips of chicken marinated with coriander and lemon and crispy fried. Then we had basmati rice, mug daal, aloo bhaja and dhokar dalna. The staffs were courteous and serving the food with a smile. Then we had bhetki paturi , chingri malai curry and mutton kasha with Bahari polao. Each of these were made to perfection. The bhetki was soft and juicy, the gravy of malai curry is so tasty and the mutton kasha is to die for. Then we had pineapple chutney and nolen gurer ice cream. This ice cream is must at the end.

I have visited the place mostly during the wee hours and have always been hosted with a smile and delicious biryani. I have tried both the mutton and chicken biryani. They usually serve big succulent pieces of mutton and once you become a known face, expect stellar service from the humble chachas. The biryani is best paired with the Mutton Kasha or Chicken Rezala. You may also try their Chicken Tandoori.",negative

6165,"Horrible will be an understatement. Had to throw away the food. It is too bad, not at all edible.
I ordered for crispy chili baby corn and drums of heaven.
Crispy chili baby corn could be taken only once, that too could not swallow the food. The corns are totally rotten and stale, the batter is made of besan, smell of oil is extremely strong. I don't know how could they sell such a food to customers. I had to actually throw away the whole dish.
Drums of heaven - a thick coating on chicken, Extremely spicy gravy, spicy as hell. Could not throw away so much of food, so has to forcefully eat it. Waste of 300 bucks straight away.
The first and last time I have ordered from this outlet. Please save your money, don't try to take this shit they serve.",negative

Side dish -

Honestly, the food quality and quantity both were good, thou the chutney they serve was stale, as well as the soup. Chicken Bharta is a must try dish i would say. The authentic traditional punjabi ambience was quite attractive. Staff service was a bit slow, but they were polite to us. They need to work on few things.

Their foods are mostly fresh but availability of items in the menu is a big question. I asked several questions about the menu only to hear Maximum to be unavailable.
The hot selling item,as usual with the other outlets is the Chicken Shawarma (both wrap and salad).

Its located in the basement of O2 hotel near airport.

Pros-

2. We ordered one U.S. french fries and an Indian Platter. Both food items were mouth watering.
3. Their LIT must be tried out if you are in The Drunken Monkey. LIT is lit AF ð

Cons-
1. We also ordered a Hookah which had smoke missing. On complaining the server changed it, still it was as useless as previous one. Being a hookah addict it was a total turn off .
2. Service was on the slower side. Considering it was sunday eve and huge crowd, that can be ignored though.

Lastly a famous dessert The Tilhou Kheer was a delightful experience.

The AC had water leaks, when we complained they told us to ""shift your chair"". It was suffocating, and we were dying to get out.

The ambience is all good except the fact that it lacks good lighting.
The place is by Kumar Sanu so there's a whole lot of bollywood theme going on.
So overall the ambience was really good.",positive

3562,"Located within a very short distance from my home, this cafe with its fabulous array of mouthwatering delicacies and an awesome decor has the potential to rewrite the 'eating out' aspect in this part of Kolkata. The Palbazar - Jheel Road junction off Sukanto Setu has been since ages been the favourite for Rolls, Fries and at the most Biriyani. There were no options of sipping into a coffee in a quiet place and munch on varied delicacies. So, this culinary destination must come out of its comfort zone of just serving loyalists and reach out to the Gen Y and coffee recluses like myself in this locality.Â

They have a variety of items one could have in a given lunch break. It is usually crowded. The staffs are quite friendly and quick in making the food. I feel their best items are cheese vegetable wai wai, corn sandwiches and momos. Their Khichdi is also amazing. One should try it if they want to have something that reminds them of home.",positive

The ambience is cosy and the staffs are courteous and helpful also well mannered. Also it provides an outdoor seating facility which is good.

Food was good and the portions were quite enough for two medium eaters.

We had
â Fish Fingers for starters. 6 pieces are served. Taste was good.
â Schezwan fried rice , again as I've mentioned that the quantity is well enough for two medium eaters.
â Sweet and Sour chicken to accompany with fried rice. 8 pieces are served. Well prepared and perfect balance of spices.

Only request is that the chefs should be a bit more careful while preparing the food as I've found a small hair in the chicken. But the owner apologised for it.

But yes otherwise this is good. Try it out surely you won't regret . Also would like to mention that no GST is charged.",positive

Thanks to #zomato for refunding us the money. Coming to the pizza - cheap quality pizza with very less toppings and cheese. This is the type of pizza which you get from local confectionery even worse. Sorry to say guys but just naming a shop pizzeria house doesn't work, you have to earn the name.

Grilled chicken burger was juicy and sumptuous, tingling taste buds while pasta itself was one of the best I've had the privilege to have. BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE was OUF OF THE WORLD. To me Rouge serves the best but this comes so close to it. I'd drop by just to have its cheesecake. Blueberry shake could've been better considering the high standard it set with its food.
Absolutely must go.",positive

The place is pocket friendly. The staff is courteous. The service is a bit slow.
Above all, a good place to satisfy your hunger pangs.",positive
3775,"Visited this place yesterday on Saptami evening. The rooftop location is definitely a plus.
Since we were not in the mood for something heavy, so we decided to go for the starters. We had Tandoori aloo, fish tikka and aloo chaat. All of them were good and went down really well with the drinks - specially the aloo chaat, with its right amount of spicy and tangy mix.
Coming to the drinks, they had a good spread - though a tad bit overpriced.
However, the best part was the sheesha. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have the option of the bigger sheesha's as well. Coming from Kuwait, where the bigger sheesha's are the norm, this was a welcome change from the miniature sheesha's you get in most places in Kolkata.
Overall a good experience and definitely holds repeat value.",positive

Griled chicken wings were okayish, served with french fries.
The price is comparatively cheaper with the food that they serve. Didnât get the chance to order dessert so canât comment on that. Moreover can be visited for the second time. A three star is what I wish to give them considering everything the food, ambience and the staffs.",negative

Ordered chicken biryani which was decided after taking a minute or two which, in turn, seemed to work on the waiter's nerves(a good loo k was received by my friend). The biryani was placed in front of us and the guy marched back to his post like an obedient soldier(not hearing for once what we were ordering next). For the food part, biryani was ok. A ghee ka tadka saved the grace somehow( it was not dry atleast)

But one thing, they didn't have any quality management, meaning, one day it happened that I had burger there with a few of my friends, and later that day, I took a burger as takeaway. The takeaway burger was horrible. Now the shop has become very small, doesn't have air conditioning any more, has very less seating space and is no more suitable for hanging out with friends.

11030,"An extremely small place located in New Market. We had food packed from here. The place is small with limited seating arrangements,actually it's better to home delivery or pack food from here. The prices are okay but the food quality a big question. We had opted for their chicken rolls only. The paratha was overly oily and the kebabs were not complementing each other. Not recommended.

9192,I had visited the place almost a month back. The experience in a restaurant is affected by several factors apart from food. They seemed to mess it up with everything. Maybe a bad day or that's the practice I have no idea. Their are loads of other restaurant in the city serving way better food. Bad experience. Not visiting again.,negative

Apparently pretty popular especially among the college lads in and around this area, these guys dish out some of the amazing tea. For snacks, one can have Samosas and Jalebis. The food and tea are made fresh, and owing to high demand, you get fresh offerings.

Famous for its moglai which is popularly called as 'Anadir moglai' is delicious, though the sabji which is served with this is not up to the mark. I also have ordered one mutton kosha which is quite tasty and savoury.

11206,"This is a small place near Rathtala, Belgharia, with excellent tasty dishes.

I generally get our dinner delivered to my house on most nights from Bangaliaana and there has been not a single day when they disappointed me.

I do not recommend dining out in case of this eatery. But if you plan on getting it delivered to your house, then let me tell you, they offer really quick and prompt services. You'll receive hot, fresh, and delicious food in no time.

Though the restaurant offers both Indian (specifically bengali cuisine) and Chinese cuisines, I prefer the former to the latter. And I would recommend the same.

Chicken Bharta, Masala Kulcha, Aloo Parantha, Chicken Kosha, Chicken do piyaazi, Chicken Masala, Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Manchurian and Veg Manchurian. Even the mutton is lovely.

The food is mostly fresh and chicken tender.
Don't go for the mutton variants though.

Falafels and chiken shwarma are my favourite. Especially like their mint mustard chutney combo (a side with the wraps). The sauce to filling ratio is good with bits of veggies tossed in. Humus/mayo isn't overly sweet. 

They don't have a lot of competition still doing well.
Seating is crunched and non existent almost.
However for a quick grab, it's pretty good.
Pricing is non objectionable.
Packaging may disappoint you, so spot eating is most recommended.",negative

People please don't order from this place or got to this place.

Tikiya wasn't much oily compared to other similar cheap priced restaurants. Taste wise it was okey. Paratha was thin, small and became hard in transport. Packaging was basic. But food is very cheaply priced here.

Aroma of biryani was little bit on higher side otherwise it was tasty.I shall review in detail once I get back to there again,I will :)",negative
7432,"Its a very tiny place, and they have tried to make the most of such a tiny place by dividing it into 3 sections, nicely designed, but the top section is a bit congested especially for the taller people, also it doesn't get the proper cooling from their AC, because of which they have a table fan above, which is quite funny in a cafe.

Now coming back to their food, I feel their menu is contradictory in nature with their name (PP's vegan). I mean we literally thought that they are gonna serve only the vegan food items going by their name, but the menu is not vegan, its vegetarian. Until and unless they mean something else by the word vegan (which only they can explain). 

Now coming back to the order we placed. We ordered one (nachos+pasta+soft drink) from their combo special, and we really liked the pasta (mix sauce)

Verdict: Will I visit here again? May be, I don't know.",negative
3234,"Suggested by a friend, went to second house for dinner. It was a great place for hangout with your friends. It has everything that is required for a great evening with friends.
Loud sound , dim lights , and pocket freindly alcohols. Seating capacity is less so avoid peak hours. Great ambience with friendly staffs. Mostly the crowd was of young bunch of people . Will suggest not to go with family here mainly at evening because they might not like loud sound.

Now coming to the food
As it was friday they offer 2:1 on every alcohol. We ordered
1.mushroom cabana - 3/5
2. Churmur chat - 2.5/5
3. Peanut masala -3/5
4. Chicken salad - 3.5/5

Not ordered any main dish as we were full by having beers and starters.
So on food side it was ok. It may improve. But other things are great.

Pocket puinch was 1200 for two including taxes.

Could not click any pics due to low light.

Waited for 10mins after that my roll was ready. It did not have double chicken and the roll was full of dalda and the sauce was scattered all over the roll which made it very disgusting to taste. Also the chicken chunks were chewy and not tender. I will never ever visit this place again in my life. The chicken roll costed me whopping 48/- bucks. There are much better options for rolls in behala like arsalaan, panna's kitchen, haji saheb etc but definitely not this one. I am attaching the pic of the chicken roll.

The Chowmein had good quantity of both chicken and egg, and the chicken pieces in the Chilli Garlic Chicken were soft and succulent from the inside.

7331,"After a long gap I ordered mutton biryani from Rahmania, Mullick Bazar. It took a long time to receive my order. First of all the biryani came in a paper box. The box contains a piece of mutton, a potato and flavourful rice. Rice is very rich and full of spicy cloves. You can fell the spiciness of cloves throughout the biryani rice. Really loved it. The medium size mutton piece was soft, tender and perfectly cooked. Long gain of basamati rice was very much satisfactory. But the negative part was poor packaging in paper box and excessive use of Dalda. As I received my order late, dalda started to thicken the rice n eventually it lead the biriyani little soggy. This kind of biryani may cause indigestion and felt heavily overburdened.

However, all reservations proved unnecessary because there were 2 pieces of perfectly looking fresh fish in a beautifull yellow gravy. It was just like home cooked food and I was delighted. The fact that Bengali food has delicate flavours and doesn't need to be dripping in oil is a fact forgotten by most Bengali restaurants. The prices too don't look to far fetched.

7421,"Ordered mutton biriyani through UBER EATS and believe me it was one of the wrost biriyani ever tasted.
It contained one mutton peice and one egg and no aloo...
No aloo means a big disappointed for me. How can I have biriyani without alu.
Even the mutton peice was so small.
Now coming to the biriyani rice, it contained excessive food color and excessive rose water.
And the main thing, it contained fresh corainder leaves. I mean why .. although I love corainder leaves but not in my biriyani ... Hated it.
All over it was a horrible experience. I am very particular in my biriyani but this is not done ..",negative

Rice quantity might be less when packing as the chicken/mutton piece with Alu takes up 50% of space so if you are hungry AF then you might need to add up an extra Alu Biriyani ð",positive

1786,Today I ordered 2 plates of chicken biryani with egg. Chicken biryani tasted below the average. Excessive use of rose water and mitha atar deteriorate the basic standard of biryani. Though the biryani include one big piece and one small piece of chicken with one boiled egg. No need to mention it's also included one pathetic rock hard big portion of potato. Really biryani of swad doesn't stand a chance in kestopur locality where so many great food joints are competing with each others.,negative

The Mr.Burger fried chicken and egg burger was a gem..perfectly fried chicken with suuny side up between two buns..exotic..
The oreo shake was refreshing.

The food was quite great specially the chicken pahari as starter which was suggested by the floor manager, an elderly person with a great hospitality.The chello kebab was Amazing and freshly done.The Barbecue chicken sizzler managed to get a nod from my fussy eater husband which probably tells how good it is!

The Pork ribs were amazeeeee balls , super juicy, coated with really good quality brown sauce ! Best I ever had(not exaggerating) Chicken Penne Pasta was creamy and the sauce wasn't overdone , with a good amount of meat !
You may think i won't write about the Coke but i will cause that impressed me too. Don't know about you but most of the time when I order Coke in restaurants (like Subway, KFC etc) it doesn't have a good amount of fizz (almost nil) even after you complain and get a second cup. This place won't let you down like that !

Service was also really good , and they also click a photo of you and give you a hard copy of it you can keep , which i have not seen in any other place : quite interesting !

1029,"It was a Christmas lunch and we had many options. Among them we chose afraa as we saw turkey and many other gorgeous names in their buffet menu online. But got a big time disappointment with the taste of the foods.
Firstly the starters served in the table was cold. They had no menu in the table so we had to ask them for options if available or not. Beer options were very limited.
Coming to the main course only one type of rice was there. The salads were mixed up and same with the desserts also. The turkey seemed to be undercooked. The only savior was pabrai's ice-cream.
Their new renovated ambience was good though.
The food made no justice to the value we paid and it also doesn't go with the brand name afraa.",negative

Firstly they are having a lengthy waiting time. I mean we ordered one sandwich and one burger and had to wait for 30 minutes for the same to arrive on our table. I mean it is christmas time so one should have sufficient staff available to shorten the waitng time.2ndly they dont take care of your order. We had placed order for a cappuccino but we never got it. Thirdly one has to decide what one has to order from outside the restaurant. This is totally not done for a place like flurys.

Both the pizzas were very cheap compared to other cafes. The taste and the texture of the pizzas were upto standard. It had good amount of cheese along with huge chunks of chicken/salami.
I loved the black current shake! The shake was cold, thick and sweet with some nice froth on above served in mason jars!!Â

Chowmein tasted very light as mild spices were used. It was well mixed with lots of vegetables and number of chicken chunks were present too. Portion was less as per combo. Boneless Chilli Chicken pieces were fresh & big in size. Once again gravy was light but bit sour in taste. Overall taste was very average for its cheap price.",negative

The ambience takes you to a different era -the rajbaadi, with the red carpet.

The place is divided in different sections- bar,cafe VIP with a view and a cozy section as well.

They have drinks and amazing hookah.

The food on the menu are all very different from the regular menu. Must try- tandoori momo , agarwal chakna plate (with drinks)
The indian platter take you straight to Delhi.
The pasta is delicious. I was amazed with the pizza, we tried the mexican cowboy and it was one of a kind.

Machhli Baba Fries is what they have christened this venture and have built up quite a reputation for themselves in this short space of time. No doubting the quality of food served, but they will be better off increasing the size of the portions. The fish items are class, but the other ones (read: chicken), though not bad, fail to match their fish counterparts. So, there is a scope of improvement in that department. The Dimer Devil is another item to savour. Food is prepared in utmost hygienic conditions too and that is a huge positive. The mustard sauce (Kashundi) that they provide along with the savouries has quite a knock out punch....by far the best and that too by quite some distance.

I gave a try to two of their exotic fries, namely Tandoori Chilli Fries and Poppers & fries. The former one tasted better along with the flavour of tandoori sauce mixed with chilli garlic. The latter did had a good amount of veg poppers topped with a lots of mayo but the fries itself tasted a bit bland. Quantity of the fries are decent and the price is kept very reasonable.

This can be your ultimate destination if you are looking around for some snacks to munch upon around Bhawanipur. Being the only fries shop serving 100% veg fries, it can an ideal destination for vegetarians.",positive

Most probably they have happy hours on drinks before 7pm on weekends. The thing they need to work on is there DJ. The DJ was repeating the same songs back to back which was very irritating. Service is good but one thing really sucks that is you can't leave your table empty even if you are dancing. They will allot your table to someone else and tell you to clear the bill if your table is empty and you are on the dance floor. This rule or thing is really not good. If your cafe has dancing floor then this policy should not be followed. Due to this reason my rating has fallen from 3 to 2 for this place.

5952,"The biryani arrived in about half hour.It was hot.
The biryani was okay and not very good.
The reason for this is you get a synthetic biryani flavour that comes from using readymade biryani masala and not authentic spices.

When you are having biryani from a restaurant you do not expect to be served biryani made with readymade masala.Making biryani is complex and once my mom cooked biryani with readymade masala that had an outcome just like the biryani from this place.

Coming to potato piece and chicken,I got an extremely small potato piece but the rest of the packets had decent sized pieces.The chicken pieces were breast meat and largish in size.They were not very tender and not very tough too.The meat was flavourless.

I got the biryani at 70rs and the price is justified at this price point.
I wont be very keen to order from this place again due to them using readymade masala for biryani.",negative

- Chocolate Mousse

Both the shakes were excellent, it was perfectly made. Fire and Ice was a spicy mocktail, it was something innovative which would be loved by the people who likes spicy and tangy food.

The Chicken Pakoras were crunchy with a meaty filling. It was pretty good compared to the ones available in most outlets at similar price points. A worthy try.
Lastly a bodylicious and strong coffee to end the evening.
Of course, the Adda among the group of four of us was an added bonanza over everything.
The service was good too.

3. Chicken Pizza: It was good. It might not give a pizza hut or dominos pizza feeling but it was good enough. The pizza had olives, chicken and Bell peppers as toppings. The bread as soft but it would have been better if it was baked properly. Overall.. You can give it a try

10197,"Well the food here is not exactly delectable but is also not unsavory. I went there a couple of times, ordered both the vegetarian thali as well as the non - veg one. Non - veg in the sense that I ordered two different fish items. Both tasted exactly the same! All the different items....whether it is Quorma or Qualia or Kosha....tastes quite the same actually.
This has always been a common problem for most mediocre eating joints. Whether it is a chicken item or a mutton or a fish item, there is just one omnipresent gravy. Everything goes in there and gets served in separate bowls! That's the only difference.....
But still....the gravy was not bad at all....that one omnipresent gravy was indeed quite tasty.",negative

This entire thing costed Rs 542 (via EazyDinner, apart from the beer). Food was good and tempting .. The staff was also polite apart from the guys who were serving food at the table.

I ordered dhoka, jalebi and tea. all of them were okay. jalebi tastes decent. the tamarind chutney they serve with dhokla is extremely sweet, it ruins the overall taste,they don't give any green chutney, or green chilly with dhokla.
I believe this place is better for delivery and it's worthless to visit to dine in.
I was given the bill after requesting for it.
also they won't serve anything in a single piece, you will have to buy samosas or dhokla or anything in a pair.

Right from the first bite I got extremely excited from what will come next with so many chutneys to mix and match.
The dosa was soft and crisp at the right places, with mysore masala spicy as it gets. It had tastes of multiple levels thanks to its chutneys.

Hence settled for regular beer and a virgin mojito with tacos and finally a shrimp although they had prawns as mentioned pasta in red sauce. The tacos were 4 in number, served with tomato relish, at the price, at least 6 were expected. The pasta was pretty and of moderate taste with nothing special.

The murgi thali was tasty. It consisted chicken kosha, rice,salad,alu fulkopir torkari,chatni, juru alu bhaja and dal. The only drawback about the murgi thali was the potato in the chicken was undercooked and the jhuru alu bhaja was a little cold. Now come to the special polao and chicken kosha. The special polao was average, nothing wow. The chicken kosha was the same chicken that they gave in the murgi thali, in here too the potato was undercooked. The polao hard some hard rices. But the quantity was really huge enough for too people.",negative

Located near Dhakuria Rath Bari or rather say Bus Stand in Dhakuria it is a small shop. Mostly it is a take away corner with lots of different items in their list. Being a local guy I often visit to this shop and the quality is good. Really can't expect better quality at that cheap price. The problem is Quantity which is not at all satisfying, for a foodie like me we need bit more to eat that what they serve. The other problem is as the shop is situated on the side of the road and it is mostly take away so the only place to stand is to on the footpath which gives rise to problems for the pedestrians. 
I have ate Egg Tarka, Panner Tarka, Egg Roll, Chicken Roll, Chili Chicken(too spicy), Egg Chow, Chicken chow and many other items.",negative

The service was good, staff were helpful although the service was on the slower side but still not a major inconvenience.
Coming to the location, located right beside acropolis mall (which is gaining its own footfall every season) the restaurant has a potential to gain more popularity.
Some food items are slightly overpriced, atish-e- aloo was good but again not worth the price they are charging. According to me the price correction is required, atleast at this stage.",negative
6811,"I ordered Chicken Steamed Momo and Chicken Fried Momo from this place. They make some awesome Momo's. I don't know why they are not so famous as some of the other Chinese restaurants for their Momo's. You definitely must try their Momo's. The only let down was the sauce. The Sesame Chilly sauce which they provided with the Momo felt like it was devoid of salt and thus didn't taste good. I thought that maybe they forgot to put salt on that particular day. So, few days later I ordered the same and again the sauce was devoid of salt. So, I think that there definitely is a room from improvement in there. But definitely their Momo's are worth it. Juicy, Succulent pieces of keema chicken in the momos..",positive

The chicken cheese balls were 8 piece at 120 rupees and we could feel the cheese melting in our mouth! The Oreo shake was perfect.. It was not too sweet nor too bland. They even gave vanilla ice cream at the top with lots of Oreo and chocolate sauce.

The prices are reasonable and the quantity is worth the price. It's easily affordable for students. The interior is pretty and the seating arrangement is good. The staff was warm and welcoming.

I would definitely recommend this to everyone and those who live in this area. It was a sudden discovery and turned out to be pretty good!! More than what we expected!",positive

They have rolls at the ground floor and the air-conditioned restaurant is on the second floor. The food I found to be very good and it's pocket-friendly as well.

Now coming to the food. I ordered tandoori ruti and one chicken tikka masala(suggested by a staff). It was really sumptuous and finger licking as well as spicy. There were six chicken pieces in the thick gravy.

I ordered the pizzeria pasta and I must say that it is one of the better pastas I have had in the city. You can clearly taste the pizza type tangy tomato flavour in a slightly creamy sauce.

Right from the time that you enter this place you will notice the narrow marble staircase reminiscent of old kolkata houses. The interior is devoid of glitsy decor; there is a space where couples can dine in an enclosed balcony kind of space.
Although the interiors are simple, the food at this place more than makes up for it, both in terms of quality and decent quantity. I have dined at this place quite a few times earlier too and it was good. Chinese cuisine, north indian along with their dessert and mocktails are worth having. Some of the stuff that I have previously had and liked were fish fry, tandoori chicken, rice noodles, garlic naan, mutton kosha etc to name a few.

I chose not to argue but to move ahead and have the food rather wasting my time and mood.
While we tasted the food it was more pathetic with small lumps of black burnt vegetables inside.

Ralli's is probably one of those places, where you can have as many refreshment drinks as you want, sodas, floats, milkshakes, Kulfis, Chole Batore and some spiced up Chats, only because this place is not gonna pinch you hard. Prices are absolutely minimal and a good value for money.

The syrups range from 25-30 bucks, the floats for a good 65 bucks.

Everyone is chattering at their peak volume.
The waiters at the eatery are in a hurry to usher you out.
There is no way you can sit and have a decent conversation.
What we ordered:
1. Kesar badam milkshake- tasted good. They put a scoop of kesar ice cream on top.
2. Dahi phuchka- okayish. Not fabulous.

Delivery was pretty smooth â bang on time, also the packing deserves an applaud â a nice pretty air tight container â very little quantum of veg pulao topped with some moong dal and lauki preparation!

Yes, the quantity served is pretty low, but one canât complain when he is paying just 59 bucks for a meal!

Coming to the food, since their funda is unadulterated healthy food, hence, they serve very nutritious stuff without compromising the taste much, which is quite remarkable in itself!

Pulao was well prepared with an amalgamation of decently chopped varied veggies and went well with the daal and lauki sabji!

Nice to see that food was warm when received â overall a pretty good experience for a very low price!

Will order some healthy food from them again pretty soon!",positive

Excellent tender succulent mutton in biryani. Superb mutton chanp (4 big soft mutton pieces) with hot n crispy tandoori roti are must try. Last but not the least don't forget to try chicken tandoori.

941,That should be 4.5 not 4.Â Not much to add to the great legacy of Mitra Cafe. Just reach Mitra Cafe by at least 5pm if you want to lay your hands on those famous brain chops that are an absolute party in your mouth. Fish Kabiraji comes next. And of course the legendary Diamond fry. Yet to see anyone serve boiled potato as side with kashundi so that too makes Mitra Cafe a one-of-a-kind place that is backed by quick service and affable waiters. They have marketed the name quite well but I somehow feel the authenticity can be felt only at the original place. So head out to Mitra Cafe Shovabazar for an evening snack with a difference.,positive

There was only one staff who was running the entire resto, Who took the order from us and made the food too. We ordered Panir butter masala as well as Tandoori roti.

New Delhi is merely a company town, the company being the government. Indiaâs only truly organic city is Calcutta.â. Since then, Kolkata still has been the pioneering city in Indian renaissance. It has long been known for its literary, artistic, revolutionary heritage and food. As the former capital of India, and now known as the âCultural Capital of Indiaâ, not only Kolkata, but Bengal is the birthplace of modern Indian inventions in the field of literature and high-quality cookeries with amazing artistic and scholastic thought. Bengalis tend to have a special appreciation for art and flavour; its tradition of welcoming new taste with full of talent has made it a âcity of intense creative energyâ.

For food I ordered, All Meat Platter- two types of chicken salami, chicken sausage, bacon, poached egg, cheesy toast and mayonnaise. Fish Finger- very well cooked, fish is very soft, served with mustard sauce. Gambas Al Ajillo- prawns served with finely chopped veggies, very good in tested. Prawns are so soft and spices are well balanced. For refreshment, Lemon Tea and Ginger Honey Tea. An economical cafe which serve some good food.",positive

7294,"The Noodle Story has many franchises all over Kolkata.With the good reviews all over the place, I went to the Diamond Plaza outlet and trust me this was one the worst decisions that I have taken.The momo stuffed was okay okay.
While placing the order, I was informed that it will take 5-7 minutes and when I went there after that time, they even did not started and they stated and there was an issue with the gas and whereas the other people who came after me got their order earlier than me.
So after a little more than 25 minutes I received my order although with an apology but nothing extraordinary.
I hope the team that works there in the stall can use their time less on phone and work on improving their service.",negative

9420,"I visited here for lunch at late afternoon so rush was less at that time. The place was not so big but was cozy enough. I ordered Tandoori Roti, Peas Pulao and Murg Bharta. I must say the service was extremely slow despite non peak time.

Tandoori Roti -

I was different from other Tandoori Roti found in other places as maximum amount of wheat flour was used thus it became crispy after a while. There was nothing special, just simple kind of roti.

Peas Pulao -

A very simple kind of rice with few peas (I think the price is high) and for flavor, cloves were present. It was somewhat cold. Quantity was enough for 2 people.

Murg Bharta -

Quantity was OK and was garnish with grated paneer and processed cheese. Chicken pcs were hard and small. Not much spicy but the taste was average.

Staff was good and the place was clean. Ambiance was cool and calm. Few improvements are required towards quality of the food otherwise it is a good place for a casual lunch/dinner at reasonable price.",negative
7495,"Location: Very easy to locate. Located just behind the New Alipore petrol pump.

Ambience: Don't expect beautiful ambience and decor. It is one of the oldest place in town serving authentic Chinese food at a very cheap price.

Food: Now coming to the food. If you want amazing Chinese food at an affordable place this is the one. Momos, wontons, Drums of Heaven, noodles, mixed fried rice, choupseys are of special mention. Chicken sweet corn soup, Sweet and sour Chicken, Chilli Pork, Manchurian Chicken are must try items. Highly recommended. If ambience doesn't matter please do visit this place. They serve amazing food at a pretty affordable price.

This place proffers an ordinary look, although its platters are extraordinary. On the grounds of this reason, it has grown its demand on the metro city as well.

As my craving had turned me into a famished beast, so my friend, being a semi-regular visitor, had decreed for Beef Biryani with Beef Bhuna and Beef Chap. Believe me, I anticipated for a bone in it, but pieces were so tender in every cuisines we had ordered, that it didn't take much time to finish it. It was truly amazing to munch those succulent pieces of beef.

9003,"I would have rated it a 4 but for the fact that the Rava onion dosa that they served me was served with small chopped raw onions. Imagine..this place with its high reputation, doing do. Probably they got the order wrong and realized that instead of plain rava dosa the order was for onion rava and the chef just sprinkled the onions and it was brought to the table and served to me. The onions should have been sauteed on one side of the dosa which would have made them slightly translucent and sweet and enhanced the taste. The service too was slow. The masala vada was also not to my liking. I've had much better ones in the various south Indian food joints in the city.The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing.

Mostly ordered here are rolls which are fairly decent in taste. Saucy and hot in the inside with big chunks of protein and a fat piece of bread to wrap everything in.

This place has an open kitchen so you would get to see your orders in making. Sadly this place does not have a proper sitting area. Service is fast and Kolkata's street food essence is strongly felt here.

Negative: not much hygienic, especially during monsoon.

I was bit disappointed by seeing the Biryani in foil, but that went away when I saw a big chicken piece in it. I dug inside and found an egg too. A little more in, it uncovered a giant potato.

Chicken piece was extremely tasty, juicy & soft.
Biryani rice was extremely well made, fully packed with flavours and rich in texture. Potato, once again was soft and well cooked too. This Biryani tasted just wonderful. Portion was okey too. It was definitely better than standard delivery restaurants.

3996,"The restaurant had a nice decor and soothing ambience. Anyway, instead of dining in, we thought it would be better to just take parcel on the Nabami night, as the place was pretty much crowded. We had ordered chicken kebab and tandoors.

The kebabs were good with subtle mix of spices and hence was a good experience. The two types of tandoors that we ordered were pretty much a letdown. They have a lot of aspects to improve upon.

The packaging was okay if not too good. The staff was friendly. I would just hope they price their items more competitively. 360 Rs for a ~1 kg tandoor is too much for a normal restaurant of their calibre.",negative

2865,"I wouldn't say that the buffet here was super amazing, but yeah, it wasn't disappointing.
I'd describe the food here as- Starters have less options, maincourse is okayish, dessert makes up for starter and main course. Dessert section here is loveeeely! ð
Okay, now I need to say something about the buffet here. Nearbuy app coupons were available for Alfresco lunch buffet at 799 per person. But on reaching there they informed us we could have used the coupon only if we had informed them beforehand in the morning. Now I don't know what's the process of informing and all that but this part was definitely disturbing. So we finally settled for non-veg buffet at Rs 1009 each getting the happy hours offer.
Hospitality here is, hands-down, awesome. The ambience is amazing too.
Pro tip: Go at sharp 12.30 pm (That's when the lunch buffet starts), then you'll have ample time in your hand. Buffet closes at 3 pm. Eat to your fullest in this 2 and half hours and you won't regret. ð¤",positive

189,"When Flurys comes to mind itâs always the park streetâs iconic location that stands out more than any other branch in the city. The place has over 100 years of tradition in the making and has been standing tall ever since. Always a great go to spot for a classic bakery and sweet shop to indulge in various baked delicacies whether it be the vast range of cakes and pastries to the freshly baked savories to go along with high tea. 

Flurys has barely disappointed in the past and I doubt will do in the future. Also if youâre looking for a classic English style breakfast, this place is a good choice as perhaps this was one of the first places to actually start serving that kind of food in the city. Definitely a favorite and highly recommend to anyone whoâs new to town and looking for good a good place to indulge.",positive

We pulled a seat in front and waited for our turn to come.The place is always crowded so make sure to reach early.Finally the plate of goodness arrived.The fresh out of the oven littis was served with an equally delicious chokha.The chokha is basically boiled potatoes mashed with spices ,tomato and chilli.The mash tasted so good that you would ask for a second helping.

At a steal deal of 30 bucks a plate with six ghee soaked stuffed balls ,this is sheer love.

And you tried different type of Chinese , Indian and Tibetan dishes. We ordered Chicken Pan Fried Momo. And the quality of Momo are good. Ambience are like roadside dhaba. You need to pay before order food. So first decided dishes and then ordered are best. They accept card payment if you order â¹ 250 or above without drinks bill.",positive

Overdose located near Deshapriya Park,Southern Avenue.
Formerly this place was a takeaway joint but now they have seating arrangements for almost 10-12 people.
Itâs a cozy nice place where you can hop in with your friends and chill out while having good food.
Because at the end we all need good taste ð

9238,Affordable and tasty Chinese delivery outlet in town..... pretty impressed with their taste and quantity.. But yes pls make sure you let them know the hotness and spiciness you want because or else I find their food way too spicy...

6948,"Had a very average experience. With out the feeling that you are having and eating at âthe parkâ the food in itself was average. 
The main course menu seemed very pale and limited. 
Marriott has a far better diverse menu. 
Coming to sweet dishes , as well very limited. 2 sweets, 3 pastries (all tasting the same). One cake and the custard (bad) . 

The starter wasnât impressive either.",negative

7112,An old name in fast food segment but I am sure this was not the taste. It was popular once upon a time . I recently had fish Kabiraji from there and was not satisfied at all. The egg covering of the fish had a pungent smell and thatâs because of the oil. So not a good quality oil is being used. The fish was good though and well cooked. I had the fish only and had to avoid the covering.,negative

Ordered chicken tandoori, mutton biryani, mutton rogan josh & enamiah special cheese kabab. Trust each of the item is best. Price, well thats the weakness its in the higher side. Zomato menu card is not the updated one. But for this kind a food you can afford a good money once a month I guess. Biryani lovers, dnt miss!!",positive
8357,Ordered their Manchurian and it was reasonable costing and it was not too good. Gravy was less but overall it was horrible. Other food options in the menu is also very bad.,negative
406,"Being a resident of behala i often step into this place..mainly i prefer to have biriyani and rolls from here as they are quite famous for those two...biriyani is good in taste,not so much oily nd also the quantity is good but not for two people...nd their speciality is tikia roll which is mouthwatering ! â¤â",positive

2115,Did not really try their food but tried their firni. Had ordered 3 firnis. The taste was nice but service is really very poor. They provided just one spoon that too not a proper plastic spoon. The packaging was very unhygeinic and very unprofessional.,negative
3985,"Ordered thru UberEats and frankly speaking ..didnot have any other good option.

Ordered lacha paratha , egg tarka and a chicken chaap.
Paratha was little too oily but the good part was it was oil and not dalda. One more star ,just for that.

Egg tarka was also not too spicy.. was like a home made tarka..some might like it, some might not.. i liked it.

Chap had too much mitha atar and was raw in some portion. Had to cook it again.

So might order from here as in that price ,you cant expect that good food.",positive

We ordered Indian Sizzler, Mexican Sizzler, Classic Margherita pizza, Fresh Lime soda and mocktails. Classic Margherita Pizza was amazing, crust was thin and had a perfect balance of cheese . Sizzlers were pretty much good. Mexican one was much better. Moctails were also amazing. Ambience was absolutely great. This place is warm welcoming and looks like it is made by a very creative mind. Great place to go to chill out with friends ð",positive
5995,Actually we have gone to this coffee shop multiple times whenever we visited Quest Mall because we loved their Hazelnut Cappuccino. So this place was ideal for our umpteen coffee dates. With this we ordered either the white chocolate pistachio blondie or the brownie which tasted super yummy when warmed slightly. On on of these dates we were served a very stale blondie and when we complained the managers attitude was not at all pleasant. So that experience has coloured our view regarding this cafe quiet a bit. Nevertheless their coffee is great!,negative

We ordered Garlic chilly red pepper chicken and seafood soup for starters. Both of them tasted very good. From the liquor section we ordered Absolut vodka and Signature whiskey. For main course we had schezwan mixed rice and hunan chicken. To our disappointment the main course was not as tasty as expected. Though it was a nice sophisticated place.

7424,"Got an offer on uber eats, so ordered the chicken biryani & paneer biryani. Total was 64 only. ð Wasn't expecting much because of the cost. But the taste was really good, and fresh.

3548,"As the name says this place wants people to have rice.I had a combo over here which has got almost everything they serve from roomali roti to papad.It had - 

1)Zeera Rice â The rice was tasty and quantity was for one person only.I will recommend Steamed Rice instead of Zeera Rice as it would have tasted better with Paneer Butter Masala.

2)Paneer Butter Masala â It was actually very tasty.

3)Dal Makhni â It was so good that I would love to come here again especially for their dal makhni

4)Roomali Roti â Could have been a bit softer

5)Raita â They serve salty version.It tasted average.I will recommend sweet version.

6)Papad & Pickles â Fine.

P.S. â They maintain hygiene.Quantity needs to be improved keeping in mind the price they are charging.",positive

Last week I ordered from here after seeing some positive reviews of this delivery outlet and Babul didn't make me disappoint. I opted for their best seller murgh tikka butter masala and one veg fried rice and two makhanwala naan.

The murgh tikka butter masala was one of the best chicken dish I had recently. Six huge Boneless chicken pieces with delicious gravy went perfectly with fried rice and naan. The quantity of rice was good. The naan was also soft, loved it.

Overall a great experience. Going to order soon to try out their other dishes.",positive

Mixed burnt ginger capsicum rice which was too good in flavour with the side dish

It comprised of 1 masala kulcha, paneer, black Dal, mix veg, Pulao, gulab jamun, raita, papad. The dishes tasted well. Not much complaint except nothing was really outstanding either. Mix veg was surprisingly the best dish. The rest were decent, but average.",negative

Something which we love mostly is there rolls.
The menu does not give you a lot of varieties to select from but it does have a compact ones.
The ones that i would like to mention are:

Chicken cheese roll : This buddy is super filling. Loaded with grilled chicken and cheese. This thing can please you a lot.

Chicken Biriyani: The basic one but their quantity is commendable.

These are the 2 things we literally order 2 times a week.
But there are a few pointers that i mention.
The food served by them is good but it not served hot. Their in house delivery needs a lot of brush up.

You can read books, play your favourite songs on the guitar hear or even choose to click with the beautiful decor all around, every arrangement is here. I went here along with a friend. We didn't have much of an appetite and settled for a chicken cheese fries. Loved it as well and the portion was quite good enough for the two of us. We also ordered a chocolate peanutbutter milkshake and a choco frappe along with the food. The menu infact has a huge range of items in the beverage section. The highlight of the day was the creme brulee. It served on a plate with some blueberry compote and a shortbread cookie. Loved it. Must try if you are here. They also have a good all day breakfast menu here and the main course dishes on the menu will surely be good as well.
I however feel, they can add in a bit more in the starters.Maybe something with fish. A really nice otherwise to meet and have long conversations over some good food and coffee.",positive
3697,"Had heard good reviews about this place so decided to go for dinner one evening. Located on the first floor of PS Magnum building in Kaikhali. Place is quite small with a seating space of not more than 20-25 people. Dark and gloomy ambience and too congested. You donât need to keep it dark for a south Indian eatery. Couches were not comfortable and dirty. Started with masala fried idlis and then went on to order cheese dosa, plain dosa, rava masala dosa, veggie Uttapam and regular masala dosa. Masala fried idlis were quite good and crispy. Toppings of tomatoes and onions gave it a distinctive taste. Dosas and uttapam came. Potato Stuffing of dosas were not good at all. Sambhar was extremely sweet and even all chutneys were very sweet. This takes away that flavour from your south Indian dishes. Uttapam was very ordinary with little amount of stuffing. Service and prices were ok.",negative
151,"One of the best biriyani joints in and around Kolkata. Kebabs and other items are equally good if not better. Special mention of the Cheese Chicken Kebab (might have a different name).

Service is extremely good.",positive

808,"Location- It is Located at the Ground floor of the Park Mansion, and can be easily seen from the main road.

Orders- We ordered for the following dishes

1. Hot Chocolate

2. Brewed Coffee.Â 

3. Frappuccino Mocha.

Serve- You have to take yourÂ own food, so it pretty much depends on how much the crowd is and how difficult it is, to make your food. But honestly, it doesn't take much time 10 minutes (max).Â 

Ambience- It is Good and a cozy place to chill and gossip, and have a dining capacity for 40 people (Approx)

Quality- The quality of the food was good, All the drinks were really good especially the Frappuccinos, except the Brewed coffee, it was very bitter in taste, and we had to end up drinking it forcefully, for the sake of money.Â 

Price- From the price point of view it is a bit on the higher side, to be honest.

Being one of the most popularÂ company around the globe for coffee, it does worth it!!Â 
You should definitely give it a visit!!",positive

Each and every item they have is a top notch starting from doda, idli, sada vada dahi Vada, puri sabji, upma, pongal. They have variety of dosa and the rava masala Dosa is a must try. Their uttapams are also too good, thick filled with onion, tomato, capsicums.

In proper Sealdah area, it's hard to find quality Chinese restaurants, what they give, is usually quantity. Sonali is not quite bad restaurant...Compared to most of the nearby ones.
Food quality is average,, soups are quite good, chowmein , fried rice, chicken etc are average. I don't like the prawn preparations here usually. The quantity is humongous...half plate rice is more than sufficient for one person.
Only interesting thing is...Some food items, like *Sesame chicken (picture given), Jack fried Chicken, Sliced chicken with baby corn & mushroom, ...These items are unique and pretty good to eat. They are rarely found in any other restaurants.
Very inexpensive. There's no point of ambience here. Fast supply of food. Hygiene might be questionable.

4499,"Ordered food from this shop with great expectations but did mistake by not reading the reviews before ordering it.
I can say that one of the worst food I have ever ate from any shop. Disappointed me a lot.
I ordered one Chicken Butter Masala, one Chicken Bharta and One Veg fried rice. Had the fried rice before and liked the quality of rice and all but when I went to have butter masala and bharta it made me really disappointed. I just wasted my money by buying from this place. The taste is absolutely bad. Bharta tasted stale as if it has been cooked in the morning or the day before not at all fresh. Butter Masala competatively better but almost the same taste noting.
I won't suggest anyone to buy food from this place if you're a real food guy. Just the waste of money.",negative

The #Chicken_Tandoori was spicy and creamy and tasted as yummy as it looked. #Naan was tender and #Chilli_Chicken was hot and spicy. The #Chicken_Biriyani beared the perfect traditional taste of Kolkata's Biriyani. However, #Mutton_Roganjosh was not up to the mark in compared to others.

Coming to the alcoholic beverages, the prices are hiked at market rates. We went on a weekday afternoon, but no happy hours. The food servings were decent.

I would highly recommend the Dhaba Mahi tikka ( Fish) for appetizer. For Main course Mutton Nali with garlic naan, Mutton Raan Biryani and the Guchhi Dal which is a different version of Dal Makhani cooked overnight for 12 hours. It is creamy, slightly sour and midly spicy and goes perfectly with a naan or Steamed rice. Would highly recommend to try the Garlic pickle.

Definitely you can try them out one of the best at that area. Rice dish and Meifun is very tasty and so was the garlic chicken.And Quantity is also proportionate to its price.Â 
Would like to thanks the owner to take personal interest it resolving the issue.

                        First time order food was really good. Taste wise it's good on today's order also. But it seems someone scooped few chicken and rice. RS 260 for this portion size seems to be quite expensive.",positive

Okay I must admit their legendary battered fish (aka Butter fry) is less fishy these days but once you break into their fish rolls you would understand why Bengal Hotel still stands tall among these new joints. Wonderfully fishy, a little sweet and a distinct taste of those two layers are what you will get from Bengal's fish roll, their best export I believe. Also do try their kosha mangsho with fried rice or crisp toast to get a taste of what old fare at Kolkata cabins used to be like. One of my earliest memories of eating out took shape here. That Bengal Hotel still tugs at my heart like the days of yore makes it a very special place indeed.Â Small request: Pls do not ever change that name board.

The food was average, the mixed rice lived up to the expectations, the honey chilli fish was delightful as well. However the Mongolian chicken was a little disappointing..could taste the dough on all chicken pieces, the gravy wasn't had a weird taste as well.
P.S: 1rice is more than enough for two.

Chicken grill sizzler(5/5) - i have to say..this is probably the best sizzler i have ever had. Chicken tastes delicious with light flavourful spices, veggies are also good, and specially the rice, that was super tasty, buttery and flavourful.

Chicken Mexican Pizza-(5/5) - Thin crust pizza with ton of chicken and other topping, also the cheese amount was more than ok. Very spicy and juicy chicken pcs tastes really good.

Caramel Custard- (5/5) - Also tastes really good.so soft and light sweet taste.

185,Honest feedback : It is really not worth the money and time. I was surprised to hear from the staff that the food quality is not up to the mark at rush hours. You seriously can't have that sort of explaination for a dish that goes horribly wrong. We ordered mushroom omlette which was not that great. Flurys original open Swiss sandwich was horrible to the core. Either they don't know how a Swiss sandwich is like our they are just fooling people around. All the vegetables were overcooked and soaked in oil. Chicken filled Croissant honestly didn't taste like a heritage dish. Infact the other 2 dishes mentioned were also heritage dishes but were disappointing.,negative

Never going back to this place. 

One doesnât expect to find a completely vegetarian place when they walk into a restaurant at Kolkata, and there are no marks or representations outside or on the signboard to indicate the same. If you walk in here without researching it, you will be sorely disappointed as I was during the Pujo this year (2018)

Coming to the food itself: The appetiser and the entrÃ©es are innovative and interesting, you might enjoy them if you like vegetarian.
The main course will remind you of a North Indian Dhaba, and if thatâs what you were looking for then you will enjoy it, else you should stay away.

I ordered

1. Chicken kabiraji
2. Chicken tikka roll
3. Fish batter fry
4. Chicken Mughlai paratha.

1. The chicken kabiraji was decent. It tasted good and had a fairly decent chicken breast in it.

2. The chicken tikka roll was awful, to begin with the paratha was soggy, and the sauce or ketchup what ever you called it, was the local coloured stuff that you see in road side food stalls.

3. Fish batter fry, I love fish batter fry so order 2 pieces of it. I was very disappointed to see two aloor chop like fish batter fry delivered to me, and one of them was not properly cooked.

4. The chicken Mughali Partha was drenched in oil, I squeezed out quite a few drops of oil from it, the stuffing lacked of taste and chicken . All I could taste was doughy thing that was used as a binder .",negative

The fish fry was a large one with chips accompanying it. Not bad. The price is reasonable. You can see the preparation being made directly so no question of the food not being hygienic enough.

Another disadvantage they have is due to licence limitation they close at 12am and they literally push you out of the place by 12am. So if you are a party animal, this is not the place for u.",negative

Double cheese double veggie pizza(4/5): pizza made from hard crusted ready made pizza bread, readily available in groceries, usually proves to be a major turn down for me.

10298,"Located 4 no. tank island at Salt Lake City. This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. We had ordered for a mutton biriyani, butter naan and Kadai chicken.

The mutton biryani was the worst one out of the three dishes (perhaps the worst biriyani ever had) followed by butter naan. The biriyani was only plain white rice quite dry in nature and with a typical smell of saffron coming out from it and the mutton piece was only a bone. The butter naan was better than the biriyani but worst thing about it was there wasn't any butter on it.

Talking about the service, these people should learn the basics before running a restaurant. The waiters were too much confused with orders and we had to call them multiple times just to change the glasses but that wasn't done till the time we left.

P.S. âThe place is kinda romantic.One should definitely visit at least once with his/her Bae/Soulmate.Candle Light Dinner options available.",positive

4699,"Very easy to locate this is a well known bar cum restaurant in the gariahat area and visible from the fly over. We visited this place last Sunday and must tell the staffs are really courteous. We had pan fried fish, crispy chicken in chilly honey sauce and pan fried noodles. The fish dish contained almost 10pieces of fish tender juicy with a crispy outside and tossed in a red sweet chilly sauce. The crispy chicken was tasty but chicken pieces were so much shredded that sometime we had to search for chicken pieces . It was sweet as the name suggests. The pan fried noodles was just awesome. Prepared with plenty veggies in black bean sauce it was liked by both of us. Quantity was enough for two and the experience was satisfying.",positive

I could just have 2-3 bites of batura and after having the lassi , my stomach gave up and I vomitted. Please never think of buying anything from this restaurant. It may so happen , that they are delivering you food stored for a month or food eaten by cats and rats for the purpose of swiggy pop. Atleast I felt so, while having the food.",negative

They serve two chutneys with the pakoras one the imli chutney and other is green chutney.Make sure you mix both of them and drench your pakoras in the mixture,I bet you will be in heaven.

9142,"Visited this South Indian restaurant Located behind E mall, chandni chawk past weeknd.  
We had order 2 masala dosas and 3 rawa dosas.

The seating area was a bit cozy and concise low budgeted tables and benches.

I hardly have had such great dosas in kolkata, 
that too at such great prices.
Rs 70/- for a masala dosa only .

Their location is pretty decent but the quality of food they delivered was horrible.
We are new to this area of new town and came to kolkata for a holiday. We wanted to order some chicken kabab n paneer to go with a few drinks. Usually anything salty n spicy can pass the test of being a decent chakhna ... But the chicken was old and refried.. to the extent that it was becoming powdery in mouth and we decided to throw away 2 plates.
The paneer pakodas were equally inedible.. and tasteless.",negative

A must visit for friends, family, couples.
I loved the decor. The caramel custard was amazing. It was lipsmacking. The pizza was freshly baked. There was a small tobasco bottle, I couldn't resist myself from adding the spice. The ambience is so perfect. The teenage Justin Bieber songs and 20s hindi albums were played. I'll surely visit again.

3289,"This was my first visit to this outlet. I ordered a Baked Momo Augratin in chicken. The server sought 15 minutes and it was delivered on time. The browned baked cheese cover was tempting and it was delicious.

But an unpleasant culinary surprise followed. The momos under the cheese cover were pan fried and the sauce was terribly pungent. I can handle spicy dishes but the spiciness was strong enough to put me off. The AC wasn't working too but I didn't really mind that as the server had acknowledged it in an apologising tone.

I find the recipe odd! Does one expect an extremely spicy dish to go under the cover of baked cheese? I expected something light and subtle.

Next time onwards, I shall stick to my choice of steamed momos and maybe thukpa.

6549,"This small little Jodhpur Park outlet is the place to be when you're short on cash but craving some decent continental dishes specially. Most of their dishes are quite friendly and reasonable with a price range within 200-300INR. Have tried their hot dog,crab meat and other stuff. This time I tried out the delicious pork combo meal of butter rice and pork kasha.
The delicately cooked mild butter rice goes well with the spicy and flavoursome pork kasha made with succulent pork pieces. You can get a good balance of fatty and lean pieces. I got 2 fatty pieces out of 5 pork pieces. A good deal at 200INR. #AgantuksBasket

â»Smoked chicken was the dish we had as starters and this is a must try dish...the taste was absolutely mesmerizing and divine...I recommended this particular dish to everyone.

â»Butter naan was soft and big and very delicious it went very well with the side dish

â»Murg reshmi massala was the side dish of chicken dipped in spicy and rich gravy and went well with butter naan.

â»Special mutton biriyani was another favourite of mine as it was cooked in fresh ghee and i loved the smell of ghee coming from the biriyani. The mutton was so nicely cooked that it was mouth melting and very delicious.

Higly recommend to everyone. Please do visit them they just make aamzing food and they are not too expensive.",positive

This place located near the metro plaza is apt for throwing a small party on a proper themed manner with the delicious mouthwatering food and of course elegant shisha, while keeping the budget surprisingly pocket friendly. Though the entrance is pretty shady and restricted, but the interior decoration is definitely worth making a stop with the soothing and relaxing ambience along with some refreshing tunes as the add ons. The people there too were well mannered and descent though they were just 2 in number.

Coming to the food, we had ordered one medium veg loaded cheese pizza and two regular coffee which was definitely upto the mark considering the and the pizza crust was perfect. The service was however little delayed due to the unavailability of the materials so required.

Cream of Broccoli Soup: Though I am not a fan of Broccoli at all, if you wanna get over your phobia against Broccoli try this soup, it's just YUMMY! 

Tricolour Pasta: Well I loved the concept of bringing three flavours together, but I felt the red sauce portion wasn't up to to the mark, otherwise it was good.

Green Apple Mocktail: Though this mocktail tasted good, the flavour wasn't near green apple at all.

But, a little distraction by the bar which has a common door with it. Very much loud music in bar can spoil mood for those who come to eat in a peaceful place. Over all it's a ok place.",negative

We ordered the Veg Sizzler, which tasted really amazing. A must try for everyone if you're visiting there.",negative

5052,"A newly opened place in Saltlake right next to Columbia Asia hospital, this place has the potential to be a real gem in Indian cuisine in Saltlake area. We tried fish tikka, dal makhni, mixed veg and tandoori roti. The fish tikka was succulent and well cooked. The ajwaim flavour made it more interesting. Dal makhni was good however the presence of Makhan and tomato were bit over the top. The mixed veg was gorgeous and what we loved the most about tandoori roti that it was actually made out of whole wheat and not wheat flour. Will love to visit again.",positive

All you'll get is a single chunk of chicken in it, a whole boiled potato and an egg. And to mention, you'll need to pay extra for raita and sherwa. Maybe, that's the essence of Bangla biriyani everywhere as I find it the same everywhere here. Later, after a few tries I am kinda liking this type too.

Talking about the restaurant, it does attract lots of Kolkata Rolls lovers.",negative

Paneer Kathi roll - Gosh this one was a true delight with the soft well cooked pieces of paneer inside it.

Bhoot jolokiya roll - This roll is an unique one. The jolokiya roll is supposed to be the spiciest roll in the world and omg this made us cry ð

1688,"Went to this place to chill with friends on a Thursday night post work.
Totally loved the ambiance of OTT along with the music. A toast to the DJ! (Though music was too loud & I personally feel it is helpful to have at least one comparatively silent corner in a pub to take important phone calls)
Coming to food & drinks, we had nachos, pasta, kebabs, beer, cocktail & hookah.
Sorry to say .. pretty lousy service.
The staff is not well aware of the menu; they took a lot of time to understand that Jamaican punch is a cocktail & not breezer.
Moreover we were pretty hungry & had to ask them again & again what will be readily available from the food menu.
The hookah pipe was leaking & they had no clue what was wrong or how to fix it.
Also, a single common washroom is a bit disappointing in a place like this.
The good part is this place is easy on the pocket, along with good food.

Nevertheless OTT was fun!

I will go back to this place again and again just to have the coffee pannacotta. The taste is still lingering in my mouth.

The drinks are moderately priced w.r.t similar Restaurants.

The variety of Non Vegetarian Starters they serve with the drinks do a world of good.

The ordered dishes were superbly done.
Kebabs with just perfect grilling. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. Fish Tikka Masala and Palak Kadhai needs a special mention.

3007,"Potstickers is a cozy little place located near Jatin Das Park metro station. Heard a lot about it and finally paid a visit this year Durga puja, Saptami. And to be honest it was a wonderful experience.

The place is very small, but the ambience is nice and comfortable on its own way. We (count three) opted for their best seller dragon chicken along with veg spicy schezwan rice, mixed fried rice and chicken shyapta.

The rice items were great, with good quantity easily can be shared. Both the rice items went really well with the side dishes. Dragon chicken was a bit spicy but really loved the mouthwatering dish. But the dish which stole the show was Chicken shyapta, the well tossed sauces made it perfect.
The price is very much affordable, gst is included in the menu which is another plus point for foodies like me. Service was quick.

We visited this place during Puja and it was over crowded and menu was selective and pre set. We had roasted chilly porks, and pepper fried chicken as starter. The porks were a bit fleshy but the taste was awesome. The chicken preparation was soft and juicy and it was a bit spicy as tossed with green chillies. Then we had mixed hakka noddles, mixed fried rice with chilly fish. The fish preparation was loved by all containing 8large pieces of fish and the gravy was medium spicy. The noodles was perfectly prepared and so also the rice.",positive

2132,"I have been obsessively ordering double beef rolls and Bhuna beef kababs from this tiny place called Zafran. Hands down, beats most other places in town in tests of taste and portion size. A full plate of bhuna beef kabab (second photo) is 75/- and makes one hungry girl extremely happy. Served with some lime and onion slices, this was a rather satiating meal. The same goes into the beef rolls, and they are simply put together, with a couple of chillies on the side, crisp, flaky paranthe, and a bit of onion to add to the crunch factor. I am yet to try their biryani, but if the kababs are this good, I am quite sure the biryani would be quite good too!

Sodpur for quite some time now! The Food that they serve is really something is cherished. I had placed order at home and here is my experience.

Crispy chicken: Perfect! Well, that is exactly as you can explain it. The crispy chicken was perfect. A crispy layer of coating and a juicy chicken wrapped inside it is something that would have taken anyone by a delightful surprise!

Tandoori roti: Well, as it happens mostly when u get your food delivered at your place, the roti are all cheery, but that was not the case here! The rotis still appeared to be soft and had the flair of the food served.

Chicken Bharta: It was good to taste, but yes was too spicy which would have been avoided. I take away one star from the restaurant because of this!

Have also tried a mix veg roti combo which was normal, nothing extraordinary.
Have also tried spaghetti here, had amazing garlic piece's, only if they had less oil it would have been perfect.
Fried rice and manchurian was abundant in quantity and tasted great. Have also tried fries here which was full soggy at the time it reached me, no complains for the same though.

Only if they have their price's a bit less, I would have ordered more frequently. Consider this outlet for any corporate lunches and you won't be disappointed.",positive

8547,"Done justice to the name, have Dacre's Lane. They have truly brought the flavours of the many famous age old food joints of Dacre's Lane to South Kolkata. A hidden gem in every way. The rolls are fantastic, the Kadhai Mutton and Chicken Bharta are delectable. But the stand out item was Mutton Stew, which was ambrosial in the truest sense.
It was my good luck that they had sent an extra plate of Mutton Stew by mistake and I felt it was my responsibility to inform them and pay for it. But on calling up, they made a lovely gesture of making it complementary for us.
Loved the food. This place has certainly relieved us of the efforts of going down to the legendary outlets at Dacre's Lane. Instead, they have gifted us the luxury to order from the comfort of our homes and yet enjoy the same taste (specially for people of South Kolkata). Deserve a 4.5, but then again...the ratings are restricted.",positive

Veg Tomato Soup â This tasted more of a Chinese soup instead of the regular tomato based! The sauces as well as veggies used in preparation were more of those used in the manchows â my verdict - fine on taste, though not great!
Dal Makhani â The item of the day â pretty tasty, but somewhat oily â to impart the taste punch!
Tawa Roti â Tawa phulkas prepared sans ghee â well done, went pretty well with the somewhat oily dal makhani!
Plain Papad - they served fried papad (instead of the regular roasted ones) â way too oily and this was more of a big let-down.

The paneer was soft and the ice cream kulfi was super unique. The kulchas were soft and aptly stuffed. The tomato soup sets up the mood and explores your taste buds.

The only dissapointment of the afternoon was the spinach soup which turned out to be too creamy and very spicy. The paw bhaji was average. Yet, the staff pushes the bar at this place and hence they get a 4/5 in food and a 5/5 for the staff.

3453,"Ordered the cheese litti and was thoroughly disappointed. In the name of cheese all that they put is a few strands in between the litti and thatâs about it. The taste is absolutely normal and the size of the same is also really small. Not worth the 65 bucks you spend. Also, the chokha which they serve as an accompaniment is plain bland. It is just mashed potatoes with hardly any taste. Bad choice.",negative

Frankly speaking didn't like most of the food. Fish fry was descent but liked the fish pakoda more, fish quality was good, mutton chop was bad, though not expecting anything special at rs 15 but it was like potato chop, didn't found any taste or smell of mutton in it. Mughlai paratha was bad, only onion masala inside so not that tasty, potato curry was very bland. Mutton cutlet, prawn cutlet, vegetable chop were not available.Â  cheap eatery no doubt, though the prices have gone up than what is shown here in sample menu card but still cheap but they should upgrade the quality little more to be in the competition.",negative

We ordered fish teriyaki maki (sushi) and chicken tempura.
The fish used in the sushi was basa fish. I tasted sushi for the first time here, to my surprise it had a mixture of flavor and i didn't get any raw fishy smell from the sushi. The main taste enhancer was the wasabi it's pungent taste activates all your senses, after which you have a slice of ginger to clean your tongue pallet.
Apart from this the chicken tempura tasted like normal fried chicken served with mayo.
That's my first sushi experience for you.",positive

These are everyone's favourite and the best get alongs sides with any dish. Everyone prefers dishes with fries on the sides and to have an entire outlet for that is such an amazing thing.

A perfect chill kind of a place for hangout.
Well coming to the order I ordered cheese mayo fries.
It was my first experience of having fries this way and I wasn't satisfied with it. The price and the quality were just parallel. There was nothing waow about the fries. It was like a basic normal fries cone.

Pizza base was very soft unlike Domino's, with ample amount of toppings in the pizza as you can in my given pictures also. Thats just not the end, then comes their signature Aussis's favourite veg pizza. OMG handsdown one of the best veg pizza i have ever had. Thick layers of mozzarella cheese was there.

Right from the entrance, you can feel the liveliness of the place. Neon lights, plush interiors, pipped music and cool, wintery air. What better can you ask for? The bar is well-decked, not with alcohol though. The open space and brilliant interiors give it an ecstatic look and feel. They have an immense seating place. One is on the outside with clear glass top gazebos, some tables here and there. Then there is a lounge on the second floor, totally covered. They are coming up with the rooftop as well, starting 25th December 2018. I personally loved the âI â¥ UNOâ setup.

4624,"This place gets all the rating for its decor and ambience. The ambience of this place is the best thing. It has absolutely retro American style diner decor and the music playing will take you to a different time altogether. I am literally obsessed with their ambience. They serve only mock tails which were really good,especially the green apple Mojito. The main course is extremely expensive and worth the money. But the ambience is worth it all. The staff is courteous but their service is late.",negative

The order was given online by my brother from a different location , and when I called and tried to change the delivery time a bit (pre-pone), though initially they told that it may not be possible, but they were very nice in actually delivering half an hour earlier, just as i had requested.

Observations / suggestions :Â  Ideally, it should have a at least a sweet item and a bhaja to accompany and the no of luchis should be 4, not 2. I feel that would be more useful along with a reduced quantity of rice (perhaps).",positive

1516,"A decent place to try out beef delicacies at a reasonable price is what it used to be. But now the quality has declined. Biriyani is the worst here with hard pieces. The beef kebab is decent. The beef handi kebab, qorma and bhuna are the things to try here, including the winter morning delight nehari. But beware the hardness of the beef fluctuates greatly.

6310,"The thing with many restaurants, particularly the multicusine ones, is that they make some food really well, but mess up with few others. An usual case is that of those which serve both Chinese and North Indian/Tandoor items. So it is often wise to read reviews and then place the order.
I ordered tandoori roti and Rajasthani gatta from here.The roti was warm and soft, and came wrapped in aluminium foil.The gravy item was good enough.They provided salad and Achar with the order.
The plus side is their pricing, which is quite economical.",positive

Last time i went with my friends we ordered the chicken spanish sandwich, panfried chicken momo, cappuccino and a green tea. The sandwich was very tasty. The chicken was not at all fibery. The secret sauce and mayonnaise combination was great. The panfried momo was good too. Only thing to complain is that one has to wait for quite sometime for the food to arrive.",positive

They forgot to pack chutney for one of the thaalis, as we received only one portion of chutney. Otherwise, the paneer was tasty, the eggs very nicely prepared. The aloo bhaja sent by them is really less in quantity. Apart from that, 2 thalis is more than enough for 3 above average eaters!
P.S. the egg curry included in the thaali is same as egg bhuna.

Please do not order the korma. The notun rokomer dimer korma looks good but it's taste is extremely oily and wiered. The picture shows the amount of oil in the korma after the eggs are removed.

I ordered two items.

â Starter: Kung-Pao fish-The fish was cooked to perfection and an amazing starter with very minimal amount of spices, chunks of bell pepper along with onions. I am still drooling over the tenderness of this dish. The addition of cashews added sweetness to it which was complementing the taste of the fish.

â Meal: Garlic Chicken and Veg-Fried Rice-Combo-This is one of my favourite combination. This duo comes with five pieces of succulent gravy chicken along with fried-rice which is fresh and not so oily. Therefore, contributing brilliantly to your appetite.

Their packaging is neat and spill-proof. The service is also quite prompt. Planning to order more from this joint soon.",positive

Ambiance was not good. It's a bar cum restaurant, people came with their kids and few guests were drunk at that time and giving slangs. Waiters were not co operative at all.

Had Basket Chilli Chicken in starters. It was really good. Then I had veg pulao, delhi butter murgh and mutton raara. Veg pulao was horrible,no taste at all. And the butter murgh was without butter. There was no taste of butter. Mutton rarra was full of fat, there was no meat. Not able to understand why they are charging 350 for butter chicken and 400 for mutton raara. It was just a waste of money. Above all they are charging 90 INR for 200ml sprite.

4)Chicken lasagne
The grilled chicken sizzler was amazing. The rice , the veggies and the chicken just melted in the mouth. It's a must try dish. One of the best sizzlers I ever had. The hot chocolate and the lasagne could be better. The hot chocolate was not too hot and tasted like bournvta. The lasagne was a tad bit too salty. The Mexican chicken was spicy just as we like it.

Opting for the Grill by the pool restaurant at Taj, instead of the coffee shop was a great decision. The restaurant can be enjoyed on a pleasant cool evening giving you a great experience by the pool.Â 

We ordered the steaks and asked for recommendations on what sauces accompany the dish best. The recommendations from our steward did not disappoint. Each steak was cooked perfectly to our preference, and the sauces and sides went beautifully with the main dish.Â 

I would recommend this restaurant to others who are looking for something more, and the ability to build your own dish with excellent sauces and choices.

We ordered murgh sufiyani biriyani and lababdar reshmi chicken. The biriyani came in a foil covered handi, it contains 2 pieces of chicken. The biriyani tasted average, but it was light, rice was perfectly cooked. The chicken dish was awesome, really rich gravy. The raita that was served with biriyani was delicious, one of the best raitas that I have ever had.",positive

And when there is a place that brings you sushi in conveyor belts, can you resist the combined temptation of fun and (good) food?! I cannot! We have tried various sushi, tempura ( I especially like the prawn), ramen bowls and curry bowls. No complains with either food or service. Only the compact seating (perhaps in keeping with Japanese culture) is not very conducive for someone my size.",positive

This is a pizzeria which specialises in thin crust pizzas.
Location: just opposite to the maidan metro gate

Ambience: well lit restaurant with photographs of English and Hindi movies hanging on the walls. The seating area overlooks the bar and the kitchen, where you can see your pizza being made in the oven.

Beverages: we ordered two Heineken

Food: we went with their classic Fire of Bengal pizza, which is a thin crust pizza covered with generous amount of mozzarella cheese , mutton keema and chilies. The pizza had a perfect balance of crispy and doughyness. It was topped with coriander leaves.
I loved the pizza to bits.

Ps: prices is little on the higher side, but compared to the quality it is okay

White sauce penny pasta- well boiled penny pasta coocked in a very creamy cheesy buttery white sauce with perfect flavour of oregano and intalian herbs. Loved this also. Also huge quantity, sufficient for two. Highly recommended

Everytime I have ordered from this place they never have minimals changes of â¹10 & â¹20 they expect to be paid â¹190 in full change and canât even give a â¹10 change in return of â¹190. Secondly they always give the zomato valets the soiled torned notes or some coins. Sometimes itâs okay to accept the change as coins when itâs of a little amount but they gave â¹80 in full coins which is pathetic sometimes spoiled notes too. For the quality they provide food is over prices. Not at all happy though had tried different food items and gives enough chances but everything remains the same. Not ordering ever again.,negative

I loved the sofa area for sitting.

Coming to the food, they recommended us to try jugalbandi kebabs, lucknowi Paratha and a chicken side dish (excuse me as I forgot the name) and Firni. All the items were delicious. The Paratha was different and I recommend everyone to have this.

We had to wait for almost 20 mins. to get our food even when there were only 2 families present at that time (6 people total). They did not serve water also.

1. Special Chow Mein Gravy: The Cantonese noodles were non-sticky and not over-boiled. The gravy was plain, simple, and full of flavours. There were plenty of vegetables in the dish apart from prawn, chicken and egg.
2. Clay Pot Prawn/ Mandarin style: This was the perfect accompaniment for the noodles. The sweet and tangy flavour of the Mandarin sauce was delicious. The prawns were big and juicy. The prawn did not lose its flavour when prepared in the sauce. Each bite was mouth-watering. 

A toothsome treat indeed. We enjoyed our lunch treat at Nu Wan Li, even though the price is a little on the higher side. The staff are very courteous and the service is prompt.

People buy from them when the queque at Dada Boudi's is too long or biriyani of dada boudi's are all sold. But here biriyani is not bad - comes with decent portion of rice, good piece of meat. But price remains same as adjacent famous biriyani shop.

But Cream centre seems to have lived up to that challenge by providing quality food and hospitality over the past few years and this new outlet is no different.

Currently they have The Great Indian Sizzler Festival going on and it's hard to pick a favorite from the diverse yet compact menu, but the hyderabadi Biryani sizzler is quite something!

3827,"Good Food!!
As a vegetarian, I should be a little lenient on rating this one as the core competency would surely be in Non Vegetarian for this one. However, I will try.

AMBIENCE: Really good. Gives a vibe of a family restaurant with yellow lighting all over. You can feel that it's an Awadhi restaurant on entering this one.

FOOD: Ordered a Subz Biryani and Paalak ke Riashte for myself.
Quantity is really good for the price charged. Despite me being glutton, could not finish the whole Biryani. Maybe if I hadn't ordered the curry, I might have.
Coming to Paalak ke Rishte, it's a unique preparation with paneer stuffed in crushed spinach. Quite a different taste accompanied with the red tomato gravy. Can be tried once.
Dessert: Shahi Tukda. A little expensive, but ultimate quality.

Overall, a must visit place for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. Won't disappoint",positive

The Biriyani was the star of the show for me and hence it is a must try. We also had their mocktails i.e. Humpty Dumpty and Out of Control out of which Humpty Dumpty is on the sweeter side and the other one is a bit tangy.

It just serves normal and routine evening snacks with no exceptions at all, infact the menu here also does not have much to offer (3 to 4 items).

We decided to have bhel puri and rose soda. Surprisingly they add dhokla in their bhel puri which is kind of weird. And the rose soda was nothing but a rallys rose syrup and soda.

7355,"For the potato and chicken burger, both filling and tasty for the amount invested, I don't expect more and its reasonable and quite delicious too, the parties are fried at ordering and even the buns are gently toasted which I appreciate, at times the quality changes which I believe is because of change in staff , if that can be looked into, it's pretty much fine.",negative

2282,"Want to write a lot about this place, yet have little words. Amazing, to be precise.

Located: one can reach the place from the Hindustan park side or can come from the gariahaat-golpark side as well.

Ordered: a lot of things and it did pinch our pocket a little.

* A lemon coriander seafood soup (this was yum)
* A tandoori Devilled crab (loved it!)
* Squid in butter Garlic gravy (the squid was a little rubbery which should not have been)
* Malabar paratha
* Pork Ghee roast (this one had too much of salt and so the owner was sweet enough to change)
* Pork Chettinad (this one was good)

Clearly had no room for dessert after this ginormous late lunch.

Craving to visit soon",positive

Firstly, the soup was amazing and really worth the money. It was thick and had ample chicken portions, mushrooms, sweet corns and egg whites.

The quantity of the noodles was extremely low and dissapointing. Both the noodles and the main course was very oily and gelatinous. The gravy of the chicken was gel-like and it was evident that it had A LOT of flour.",negative

Veg Fried Rice -

It had peas, carrots and spring onions. Rice grains were long and was properly cooked. But something was missing as the taste was like normal rice or pulao.

Paper Chicken -

Chicken pcs were big and contained 4 pcs. The gravy was very simple (zero spice and less flavors) which seamed like soup. Chicken was hard which made chewing difficult.

Normal chit chat, low mood , time pass , parties this place has been witness to everything.
Even now wen I plan to visit Kolkata I try to go to this place.. lovely staff, friendly ,always welcomes with a warm gesture.
Food is good..one of the constants in Jadavpur area. I think I have eaten almost everything in their menu.all praise.
Mutton bhuna gosht and mirch murg ka salan one of my fav here accompanied with kashmiri naan.
Keep up the good work and looking forward to visit GG whenever I come to Kolkata..

2433,"We wanted to try the Thalis as it, beside being the recommended dish, has also variety of foods. But the wide variety of contents of the Thali scared us that we will not be able to finish it & the food will get wasted (also saw some co guests wasting their food in Thali). So we opted for Ã  la carte. The tasty foods satisfy our taste buds. I must mention about the courteous staff. They were so gentle, friendly, patient & well mannered. We called one of the waiter for a number of times as we were confused whether to opt for Thali or Ã  la carte, but he showed his level of patience & welcomed us every time with a smile. Looking forward to visit it again.
P.S.- Please have a Thali for people who have a little appetite.

fresh lime soda- we had different choices fr the flavour and we were given as we hd wished for
crispy chicken- the quantity is what you will shocked at. this dish alone made us full.
the chicken threads were crispy and the taste was also good.
fish malai tikka- the pieces were so soft and juicy that it melted down as soon as we put it in my mouth! it was the star of the night.
cold coffee- amazing
we thought of having fried rice and a chinese chicken dish however the quantity of starters dint let us order thatð

Galauti Kebab Was Nice in Taste But the Lacha was a tad bit on the bigger size with the Kebab , A Slight Smaller Lacha Paratha Could Have Been Good May Be , But Over All Nice.. Kebabs Shape Could have been better though ,
The Disappointment Was Dal Makhni , It was a total disaster , The Makhni Way too Many Floating On The Dal , It Had Ginger Julians Quite Big in size also the dal didnt melt properly neither did it have the proper thick consistency and it tasted bit tangy and sweet..

They served a really big tangy mocktail which I absolutely loved, then for starters they served two chicken legs with a sweet sauce and mouth-watering chilly potatoes with sesame seeds, the chicken legs were extremely crisp and yum. For main course they served chilly fish and fried rice and let me tell you it was the best chilly fish I tasted till now.
For dessert they served a tutti fruity shot which was really small but quite tasty.

On entering this place, all one can hear is the sound of cheap loud music banging on one's ears. There is literally nothing like an ambience, just mere seating arrangements and low lighting.

Everything could be excusable if it lived solely to the name of even being a Hookah place. The Hookah served here was neither fascinating nor well made but was rather choking. It was far overpriced above it's standards and hardly any joy. The service was extremely slow and inefficient and the annoying music added up to making conversations harder.

The crowd swayed up to it, therefore not an ideal place for people seeking quality time.",negative

6567,"I ordered a Murgh Handi Biryani yesterday, via Zomato. I got it for just 132 bucks, because of a 20% discount by the restaurant as well as a 150 rupees discount from Zomato. I was quite unsure about the food's quality after reading so many mixed reviews. I tasted the food as soon as it arrived. The rice was pretty well cooked and the flavours were good. Three large pieces of chicken, 2 eggs and 2 big potato pieces were just more than enough for the money spent. But the chicken wasn't soft at all. It didn't have any moisture, which indicated that it wasn't marinated well. Overall, the experience was not bad, but the quality is not suitable for the original cost.",negative

It was nice and cozy and lights were low creating a great ambience.

Staff were very generous and helpful.

ð¹Dry chilly chicken- it was topped with minced green chillies and tastes good
ð¹Veg Wanton- it was nice and crispy stuffed with cabbage and veggies in it
â¾ï¸Main Course
ð¹Veg Fried Rice- it was normal but full of spices, and any spicy lover would loved it
ð¹Egg and Chicken Fried Rice- it tastes good and had a lot of meats in it

11033,"This is a small but efficient fast food joint located not exactly near the new market but on Motisil St. which connects Lenin Sarani to S. N. Banerjee Rd (Regal Theatre).

The name suggests it to be a Punjabi/North Indian fast food joint but it isn't. In fact, they mainly have Rolls and Chinese menu on offer. I've always loved rolls in this area and this particular stall offers some great ones. Apart from it, rest of the items tastes good too. It's completely pocket friendly and two people can fill themselves up in around Rs 250-300 max. They don't have any covered seating arrangements and basically a take away sort of a counter. One can order and just sit on the one or two available chairs, that's all.

I'm surprised not to see a single review about this outlet. Let me open the book with mine.",negative

2849,"Dark and cozy place to hangout, nice ambiance but unfortunately no dance floor neither greatly appreciated for music played over there.

But the starters are good to taste. Green Chili Chicken was superb, fish finger was so so, fish taste could have been better but the Cajun spicy chicken was spicy and different in taste. I clearly recommend green chili chicken and Cajun spiced chicken. The grilled chicken with pepper sauce was not at all upto the mark, mashed potato was sweet in taste, chicken steak was hard to chew and the sauce also not good enough to make you please.

Most of the beer was not available as a form of tower on tuborg and kingfisher.

High mid range pub good food, mid range liquor, but they definitely need to improve in music to catch the mood of the crowd.

Definitely I will visit again.

Ambience is slightly shabby, not well lit area, and they have an amazing collection of all the cameras that have been used for film/serial direction of the past decades and posters of several hit films of movie industry worldwide pasted on the wall but the arrangements of the decor gave out a very chaotic vibe in general, failing to make a decent effort of sticking to a themed restaurant decor.

It is located near the Patuli Police station area and is easily available on the Google Maps.
The restaurant is decorated totally like an authentic Bengali style with Classic Bengali songs playing in the background makes the ambience feels like home. The restaurant is simply lit with minimum highlighted lights on the wall makes them bring a special retro look.

Sandwich was so no sandwich, it was like the worst sandwich. Coming to the Pizza, they should be banned for baking such disastrous pizza's.
The base of the pizza was just Yuck, so bad, the pizza sauce had no taste, and the Cheese quality was just simply sad. I don't even get, how someone can suck up making a pizza in so many levels, kudos for that!

Heard so much about this place from all my friends thought of trying this one. Went there with my buddy for our Sunday adda session. The nice courteous staff combined with some lively music and cute decor is sure enough to enliven your spirits while you enjoy the lip-smacking food.

What we had -

*Brownie Shake
*KitKatÂ Shake
*Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler
*Chicken Steak Sizzler

I highly recommend both the shakes. The right amount of cream, brownies and ice cream will make you crave for more. Coming to the sizzlers, I absolutely loved theÂ Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler. If you love spicy chicken wings tossed with bbq and chitpoleÂ sauce, then this one is sure to blow your mind. The Chicken Steak Sizzler was also good.Â 

Will try their famous breakfast platter and caesarÂ salad on our next visit and update the review soon.
Till then, HappyÂ Gorging! :)

I tried their ""Fried Litti"" and it was very good... And take home their Litti Platter and Thekuas... Among them I found the ""Corn and Capsicum"" and ""Paneer Labbabdar"" Littis to be the best... And last but not the least the ""Thekuas"" is to die for... Those were awesome...

Pocket pinch is bit high I felt...",negative

It's a very small eatery that serves quality food. Especially liked the Hondo's Shepherd's Pie (chicken). It is indeed a pocket friendly place like they claim. Would love to visit again!",positive
7514,"People who judge the outlet for it's ambience, let me tell you this was how eateries of Calcutta (before it became Kolkata) used to be. If you love check-ins more than food then surely this is not a place for you. You might not feel that the place is perfect for your selfie. Walls are not properly decorated and no attention is provided to lighting as well.

Then why should you visit this small outlet??

This place is for people who love FOOD more than anything else, and when it comes to good and affordable food the outlet is second to none. Be it hygiene or taste it's a sure 5/5. More than that the place is easily locatable and has a very friendly and welcoming staff. Every item here is nice though the Fish Kabiraji is something you should not miss.",positive

Visited Nawab's last week for lunch with some friends and tried out some dishes which they had on offer . Yes , Some Dishes only . Because despite having a vast menu , they had almost nothing to serve us except chicken items. Fish , Prawns and not even the Mutton was available . We had no other option but to go ahead with our order . The food wasn't great but good enough to ensure a satisfied gut .

What we Ordered :
â«ï¸ Boneless Chilli Chicken - 3/5
â«ï¸ Chicken Tandoori - 4/5
â«ï¸ Chicken Seekh Kebab - 4/5
â«ï¸ Murgh Butter Masala - 3/5
â«ï¸ Cheese Naan - 3/5

And from what I can say this place serves food that's a total bang for the buck. The taste was above average. I felt they should have incorporated more flavor to the noodles. But the quantity, man oh man the amount of chicken they added with the big heap of rice noodles is a big win-win for the both of us. The chicken was tasty, the vegetables were fresh (well, kind of) but the quality of the chili sauce could be better. All in all I won't say that I'm not satisfied. There's definitely room for improvement but what they serve and how much little they charge for that is absolutely amazing.

If you are here for alcohol then I would personally recommend not to drink it here as they aren't serving the actual drinks. They are diluting it with other liquids. Food was really nice.

The food is quite good. We ordered Chicken stew with bread and tea. The chicken used was very fresh and it tasted good. The stew too tasted great and had all the right ingredients in right amount. The tea too tasted great. We had 3 chicken stew with bread and 3 teas which cost us a mere 250 bucks which I suggest is very cheap if you consider the quality of the food.

We had ordered a dosa which was served with three chutneys. The coconut chutney being my favourite. The food was served without having to wait for long. The waiting time increases as the place starts to crowd. Overall, I would refer this restaurant over many other places due to it's silent and pleasing ambience.",positive

10412,"we visited this tiny authentic chinese foods spot..they have sitting arrangement for only 8 people..
now coming to their services:

food quality n quantity: both were good. just slightly above average.

service: prompt. but u can't find suited waiters here so if u r looking for something fancy, don't visit this place. the waiters r young lads who are still naive n you might face communication or language issue, but you ll get whatever you want.

interior: as i said, nothing fancy.

we ordered chicken fried rice n kung pao chicken..n as we are accustomed with 'Indian-Chinese', the taste of kung pao may disappointing. they do not have anything in 4-6 pieces, all r served in 8 or 10 pieces.

There's nothing to say much, if u r a foody n happy with good food, u may give a try. This place is certainly not for dates. n they are quite pocket friendly too.. ciao ciao.",positive

For food, we had ordered ""Tripple Schezwan"" which was basically rice and noodles cooked together. It was good in taste.

For drinks, we went for their signature drink ""Bubble Mojito"" and ""Brownie Shake"". Both were good but I liked their brownie shake more since it literally had brownie crumps all throughout the drink, unlike other cafes.

The dish was a tad salty for my palette but the momos had sumptuous and tasty fillings and the pan sauce had a punch regarding its heat.

All the contents of the burger are present like lettuce , mayo, ketchup, tomato etc but it's not worth to spend 50 bucks on this. It's much better when you make at home. One would imagine that the menu is small and hence the quality should be good but unfortunately it's not so. This joint needs a lot of improvement....",negative

The veg pakora was basically an assortment of pakoras..while one was paneer, one was gobi, one cheese, one mushroom.. very odd!!!
Not a nice experience.",negative
9358,"The ambience is very pretty with comfortable seating space. But the food written on menu is just not available. We asked for mutton/lamb/ Indian tandoor..none were available. That's a big letdown. 70% dishes on the menu were not available. Expected so much more from this one. We ordered Golden Fried Prawn, Shriracha Chicken Wings, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice and Double Fried Pork. The taste of Shiracha wings was okayish. Felt a little stale and smelly. Golden Fried prawns were double battered and over thick. Fried Pork was good. The Burnt Garlic Fried Rice tasted just basic. Not upto the mark.",negative
13,"This is one of those classic restaurants in Park Street,you have to visit once if you're in Calcutta!Been there countless times,and no visit to Peter Cat would be complete without the customary signature dish,Chelo Kebab (Talking about the Chelo,it's one of it's kind in Peter Cat; i've tried the ripoffs in other restaurants but none matched the taste buds titillating capacity of Peter Cat's version)Other notable mentions would be the Bhetki/Chicken meuniere,served on Banana leaves with the lip smacking white sauce.If there's room in your tummy for more,the Mutton Dum Kiraan with naan is something you should definitely try . All this go hand in hand with the quirky named cocktails.I would have to say there's room for improvement in the dessert section and getting a table here on a busy evening is a special feat. If they would only allow advance reservations!All in all i would never give anything below 5 to Peter Cat,hope they maintain their standards through the years to come.",positive

Ordered fish finger, egg chicken roll, chicken roll with chicken kebab and chicken pakora. The fish fingers were stuffed with fish and it was so crispy. They served it with fries and kasundi. The egg chicken roll was sumptous and it actually works as a wholesome snack that you can skip your dinner. The chicken roll with chicken kebab was pretty good as well. The chicken pakoras were tasty but I would have been happier if there had been a bit more of chicken.
The Fish Fingers are a must try. Truly a show stealer.",positive

6871,"Baan Thai has always been a very popular upscale Thai restaurant for the crowd of Calcutta. I have a fondness for Thai cuisine and believe that 5 star hotel Restaurants make the best Thai food. The decor is very classy and something that you would find in a 5 star hotel.
Though I enjoyed my meal I personally feel that its very usual and nothing extra ordinary,even the menu is very basic nothing that stands out.

What I ordered:

-Warm Asparagus Salad : I like a little bit of crunch in the asparagus which was missing but the flavor was good

-Phad Thai : very well made. Sure the seafood Phad Thai would be excellent too

-Vegetables in Ginger Garlic sauce : the mushroom used was excellent and the sauce was made phenomenally.

The service is of high standards although a very fast movement of waiters disturbs the diners and I saw some very casually dressed diners in a fine dining restaurant and I think they should stick to a dress code.",positive

10884,"A few days ago I would have had good things to say about this place but I guess good momos are not the only thing that makes an eatery worth visting more than once. We are used to ordering momos from this place since the price is reasonable and the food is not altogether inedible. We ordered 3 plates of steam momo and waited for one and half hours for the delivery to arrive. After a long wait we decided to call them up and all we get is "" we forgot to process the order"". 
I guess the staff could not care less about the regular customers. There was no hint of regret  in the staff member's voice and no urgency to undo the mistake. 
Service and quality of food speaks on behalf of the eatery. I hope they will remember to provide the food and the services to the next customer :)

The place is quite old it will surely make one travel back to the old days. You have two options available either you sit on the mat layed on the ground or the usual table chair room. They ask you whether u would like Ur food served on a banana leaf or a plate. And the plate is a huge heavy brass plate. Eating here is a one of a kind experience food is extremely tasty and they are quite famous also in the locality. If you are carving for mutton and are planning to visit here then u must be early coz it is there best seller and it gets sold out very quickly. They serve a variety of fishes , chicken and prawns also.
I had the prawn along with rice and mashed potatoes (Allu chokha). Everything was just yum and out of the world. I paid 175 rs for my lunch and was left highly satisfied.

The white gravy one tasted like chicken stroganoff even though we didn't order any. Sorry but not sorry, I don't think I am going to visit again to try any items.

Went to the washroom to wash my hands the basin was overflowing with water and no place to wash hands. No one was there but the tap was on overflowing the basin with dirty water.The water had pieces of small soap floating in it.

The commode was overloaded with human faeces . After seeing all that what I ate was about to come out. Same was the condition at the gents toilet as reported by a friend of mine rather condition was worser in the gents toilet as reported by him.

The Rajma Chawal Sizzler was one of its kind, with very good balance of spices.
The Kung Pao Sizzler was amazing as well, i loved the tangy taste of it.
The next mention would be Mustard Paneer Chilli Sizzler. Well, its made of mustard sauce or ""kasundi"" with a well mix of the flavours.

No wonder they offer complimentary soft drinks with their Biryanis probably to gulp down the worthless piece of meat & rice.

It was a very pleasing experience. Good Food, Good laughs and Good friends. I was content, I was satisfied, I was happy.

I have been to many buffet outlet and often to Barbeque but I must say this has been my best buffet experience.

In starters, I enjoyed items of fish, prawn, chicken, mutton, paneer, Broccoli, Cauliflower etc.

The Best thing was unlimited pepsi glass for Rs. 50. Just for Rs. 50 I can have any number of glass of pespi. This was an offer hard to miss.

Desserts were as usual.

As compared to Barbeque it does miss pan, kulfi and a few other items. But, I would still rate it higher because food seemed fresh and rightly cooked unlike being roasted over and over again.

â Type: Online delivery
â Cuisine: Chinese, Asian, Thai

While scouting for new restaurants to order a side dish for dinner, ""Cloud kitchen"" was on the top 5 highly rated list. We decided to buy a fish main-course to enjoy with our pre-cooked steamed rice and Aloo ki Sabji for dinner. We ordered:

1. Chilli Garlic fish: Boneless pieces of fish, batter-fried and cooked in a spicy- sweet and sour sauce. The fish portions were soft and juicy. The softness of the fish along with its hot and tangy flavours triggered our taste buds. The sauce was neither too spicy nor too sweet. We will try their other Chinese, Thai and Asian preparations sometime soon. This restaurant is definitely worth a try.

10863,"The ratings of 2.9 on Zomato for this particular eatery might incite varied thoughts in the minds of Zomato users but the perspective should be very clear on what points a user rates.

Surely, this is not a premium range Chinese eatery and it is absolutely baseless to expect such taste or hospitality out here. However, one should keep in mind that, it is obviously better than the roadside vendor serving you his own recipe in the name of Chinese. Furthermore, you get to eat your food being seated which should be considered too.

The taste of the Chinese provided here is not a great one nor can it be termed tasteless. The behaviour of the staffs are okayish and it is a place for people expecting to have food to fill their stomach not their essence. It is generally filled with people of teenage to adult age group. The price they charge for the food they provide should be termed ""moderate""; but, it is actually an eatery for cheap food.

1. Prawn Magic Funny Fry which was crispy coated with corm flakes.
2. Chicken Khichuri- Served with generous dollops of ghee and a chicken leg piece was yumm.
3. Mutton Pollanno- This resembles a Biriyani but has a subtle taste which I really loved.
4. Baked Bhetki Cheese Patishapta- The showstopper of the day. They have numerous Patishaptas to choose from, but this one is highly recommended.
5. Gondhoraaj Chicken with Ghee Paratha- This was not so great as I expected a strong flavor of the Gondhoraaj lemon, but it lacked that. Paratha was big in size and tasted good

5. Baked Patishapta for dessert- This was extremely delicious and you must end your meal with this if you have a sweet tooth. Will surely revisit.",positive

:
Ordered Afgani Pomfret and Mutton Rogini, and here are my takes on the both.

While the Afgani Pomfret was good size wise, it needed to be roasted more! It was kinda raw and lacked the correct amount of spices! 
Plus the packing was awful! The fish broke in the event of getting delivered!

:
Again with the mutton, it tasted nice! Literally nice. But they are giving you 4pieces for just 260/- odd!
Result ? Pathetic pieces! Small and all the fat content. I had just one proper piece with meat, rest 3 had to be dumped because they were nothing but fat!!

Wide range of appetizers to begin with, continuing to over 20 dishes for main course and the best part? For the dessert lovers and the sweet toothed folks, you can sort your cravings with almost as many as 40 different dessert items to choose from within their collections! 

Additionally, Marriott boosts it up with their live counters serving different items each day. Truly a great place for any meal of the day.",positive

4886,"Ordered their Chicken Shawarma Salad through Zomato. Delivery time was on point with good packaging. The delivery person even considered the fact that I had put down my address wrongly mentioning my home address and not the office one and agreed to make a change. So pretty impressed with service. Coming back to food, salad was really tasty with the lettuce, olives, chicken, cabbage dripped in dressing complimented by soft Pita Breads. Quantity is enough for 2 people looking for light snacking and not ready to kill for food. But the mayo content is very high in dressing instead of hummus that is usually served in Shawarma. Looking over the Indian twist on the ""authentic"" Lebanese dressing it was a pleasant experience. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes.",positive

259,"We went there this Saturday . I really love to visit rooftop restaurants, and this was not a disappointment either. Spread over three floors, the second and third ones had rooftop views ., though the second floor, where we sat, had much too loud music for our liking.
However, the view was great. And they had an event coming up.. For which we couldnt stay for long .
Anyway, as far as the food was concerned, tastes were great! We had pasta in mixed sauce, and creamy spinach stuffed grilled chicken , and bromelia bubbles. All of them tasted great, especially the sizzler.
We also tried the seesha which was great as well.
Would love to visit this place for a longer period someday ð",positive

The gravy was very tempting to look but lacked the punch which is the hallmark of of this signature chicken dish. Moreover, excessive use of red dried chilli made the item very hot and due to that whatever taste was left of the gravy had disappeared. In future the restaurant should be more careful about the portion they serve. Such small pieces of chicken against a high
price tag is a total waste of money on a Sunday morning.",negative

That made up for every little flaw which we experienced in the beginning.

Then comes the food. Even though the buffet was not very elaborate, the limited items they had all tasted good. The mix vegetables to the kulchas and the rice.

It took them another 20 minutes to serve a cheesecake which was absolutely stale and stinking. I even tried to cut a slice but the texture felt different. Only a person who has lost his sense of smell can present this in front of a patron.

22 chicken tandoori styled pieces, in a sour sauce made of curt and whole spices, at a price less than â¹250.

How does it taste?
Up to the mark I'll say.
The pieces are small but, yes, the chicken fibres are soft and the masalas are incorporated perfectly to each part.

A way too sour in my opinion.

Now the Kung Pao Chicken - tender n juicy chicken lightly coated, tasted good. Though I like the dry version of this preparation more.

Visited the restaurant twice before. They serve alcoholic beverages also. Cordial service executives. But the restaurant looks dull, they need to work on it.

They maintain their food quality consistently. Good portion as well. Very reasonable. Definitely Recommended. Golden City",positive
3828,"Easy to locate. Food was overall good, nothing extraordinary. One of the Fish Kebabs (Afghan Mahi) didn't taste nice, the fish didn't seem to be fresh. Service was slow but the staff are courteous. The soda shikanji and fresh lime soda both were on the saltier side, in spite of ordering a mix of sweet and salt. The mutton keema biriyani tasted good although there were very little amount of keema. Murg Rara was also good. Had high expectations from the place but we're kind of disappointed.
PS: We were charged with an extra order of 7 Fresh Lime Sodas. We noticed it after paying the bill, and settling that matter took up a lot of time. So please check your bills before paying though we believe it was completely an unintentional mistake.",negative

But what happens when you wait for 40 mins for your order and the order comes wrong. The disaster happened to me last week when i ordered food from here via a Food Delivery App. My order was Prawn Chow and Egg Chow and they sent me Egg Chow and Veg Sechzwan Chow. I mean Seriously where is my prawn? Dont they even read the order correctly, Who ever is accepting the order there should buck himself up because this is not a very ordinary mistake.Â 
I had to rate 3 because i cant give 2.5 and just to justify the 2.5 is the quantity they provided, One Chow in that price is very sufficient for two person.

But a major downpoint according to me is the price of alcohol. It High. And i was very disappointed considering there are places where the same alcohol is served at low rates.
If i would have known before, wouldn't have gone there for alcohol or shisha.

Plus, they ask you to be a member by paying â¹100 and when asked what are the benefits, they say nothing as of now. Then how can you ask someone to pay and be a member when there is no benefit available.

Was waiting to Go to this place but turned out be sheer disappointment.

The ambience is also pretty basic, nothing to get you pampered. Having said that, they offer both north Indian and Chinese cuisines, as well as basic fast foods like rolls and all. I have been to this joint once and after tasting their food I was completely surprised. Considering their shabby and dull set up, I was really not expecting their dishes to be so exquisite and perfect. The quantities served was also abundant. The staffs were very courteous and helpful, the service was pretty smooth and the prices are not than reasonable.

We had ordered:

1. Tandoori Roti - This roti had made with wheat, From my side it was a bit hard but my colleagues said that was good.

Had asked for an egg do pyaza which turned out to be sinfully tasty affair. Mutton kasha was also good though I wouldn't call it something exclusive.

7670,"Well what can you expect from a 5 star restaurant?
All was upto the mark from their ambience to their service!
Staffs were professional and well groomed.
Now coming to their food, I ordered:
1. Soya Honey Marinated Chicken Wings Served with House Salad and Tomato Ginger Glaze
2. Thyme Marinated Grilled Chicken Breastâ¨Grilled polenta, sundried tomato pesto and burnt garlic sautÃ©ed vegetable with mushroom sauce 
3. Tiramisu (Traditional Italian dessert with amaretto)

But somehow, from what I observed the food was not upto the level you expect from a 5 star restaurant. There was unbalance of flavours, especially in the chicken. Wine was good. Desert was excellent. Overall a good experience. Do visit but with less expectations.",positive
9874,"It was a BAD decision to dine here.

The people tending to the diners do not heed to the customerâs wishes. We tried to negotiate with the management about the seating since we were a big group of 12. They were seating 6 of us in one corner and the others in the far end of the other. They were simply not adjusting and ill-treated us all who tried to talk sense into them. They themselves did not adjust but when we tried to adjust ourselves, they were all the more pushing us to go out.

They kept telling us again and again âOlypub is open.â My question to the management- Are you the personal propaganda partner of Olypub?

Our only fault- we wanted to sit close together so that we could all talk while having dinner.

We ordered drinks and chicken, pork, rice/chowmein, crispy chicken, fried fish fingers. The food was okay though.

The rating I gave is only for the food and overall VERY VERY disappointed with the experience.",negative

Sizzlers-

Chicken Sizzler
Pork sizzler
Mixed veg sizzler
The quantity was generous and the i really have to say that it was glazed to perfection and sizzled to taste!

Baos-

The baos were soft and fluffy and was presented in a completely different way.

We also had some items from their a la carte menu-
Pan fried noodles
Hakka fish
Thai fried rice

However I wouldnât recommend this). For the kid in our group we ordered the chicken Penne Arrabiato Pasta which was good.

Can't demand authentic spices in kebabs or authentic crispness in fried chicken at such low prices,but its good enough.

1534,"This place is subtle. It has got a simple menu. Hookah is well prepared. Dishes were served fast.
It has got closed and open areas. In the open area, there is a cabana style seating arrangement which will give you your own space. It can accommodate 5 people per cabana. And there's three cabanas and a high table in the centre of the open area.

My review for what we ordered.

Orange Galaangal - well prepared Mojito.
Fusion - Good Mojito with a tinge of strawberry.
French Fries with Cheese - it's just simple fries with cheesy dip. The name is quite deceptive. This is the only dish which disappointed me. The salt content was also quite high.
Pizza - You can choose 4 toppings to make your custom pizza. It was a crispy thin crust pizza.

The price range is similar to other cafes. It also has North Indian options if you want to have the same.

A must visit for everyone.",positive

I had the opportunity to visit them during my short stay at Kolkata. The food is absolutely at par with places like Hole In The Wall in Bangalore or Pasha in The Park Chennai. 

I tried the potato fries and the Oink burger! Trust me I have never had fries like that before. Texture and quality wise they scored pretty high. 

Quantity wise, I could clearly see them maintaining a standard and at par with any bigger brand out there. 

Pricing is surprisingly on a wee lower side. Easily a difference of 10% from the regular brands. 

Presentation is great and they pulled it out in a record 12-15 mins which is exemplary.

Excellent hospitality and I wish the team led by Atrei (Founder) wonderful days ahead! This place should be on your watchlist if you are in Kolkata and especially Salt Lake.

We ordered:
â¢Pasta in Pesto Cream:
It was well prepared. The pesto sauce wasn't very strong and the seasoning was just right.
â¢Bhetki Sizzler:
This had many elements in it. It was having a well cooked piece of bhetki in a unique tasting sauce. It was quite impressive on the whole.

This was more of a chocolate Oreo Shake so I was a little disappointed not to find the exact mint flavour.

Firni : It was awesome.. â¤ï¸

Pocket Pinch Rs. 905(including GST) for 3 people.. But they didn't serve regular water rather serve a bottle of 1 litre Kinley and include the price of it in the bill.. Recommended.

The kitchen here can proudly stand at par with some of the best food Iâve tasted all over the world. The quality is impeccable and itâs honestly the little touches that really elevates Salt House for me - the malt vinegar that is served with the battered fish and chips, the fact that they serve cottons ginger ale, the home made garlic bread that is served with a luxuriously scented prawn dish to mop up that sauce and the attentive service. Beyond the quality, itâs the vision and the synergy that the food has with Bengal - No other restaurant in the city showcases our amazing flavours such as gondhoraj, kasundi and kolmi saag.

The food is amazing though they only serve vegan food but is still amazing in its category. The Virgin Mojito, Mavericks style chat and Paneer Saslik is a must try there. The best thing that they offer is Chocolate Fondant, a kind of desert. This tastes perfect. It's a must try !

Tandoor and kebabs are also decent. Little bit oily but tastes nice. Place not so hygienic but very reasonably priced. Biriyani is also OK types. I would have given it 3.5/5.",negative
5316,"The staff was courteous and polite.

The ambience was good with games to add fun to conversations and unwind on a Friday . We went there for lunch.

Haze special shake and Brownie Cold Coffee was delicious.

Cheese fondue Pizza was pizza stuffed puffs with cheese fondue dip. It was delicious with unique presentation.

Aglio olio Momos were a twist to the usual momos and absolutely amazing. Their best seller.

Mascarpone Rucolo Pasta was creamy cheese sauce and with a side of Garlic bread which was ordered as a spaghetti was tasty too.

There was no out of the box dessert worth ordering so we avoided it.

*The washroom was amazingly designed* If u visit there please check it out.

Overall it was a good experience and one time visit.",positive

5179,Mainly a South Indian Food serving restaurant located#Kalighat(Hazra).The restaurant deserves 3 star according to me as quality of food varied for two items I ordered.The Plain Uttapam was amazing.The coconut chutney along with it was very nice and tasty and the Sambar was also delicious.The problem went with the second order that is the pizza.I ordered the Family sized pizza but to my disappointment itwas just a bit big than the small pan pizzas.The tasty was overall fine but not worth the price.So the dining experience went a mixed episode.,negative

This is a ring-shaped idli stuffed with mashed potato in the center along with other toppings and of course the delicious sambhar and coconut chutney!ð

1679,"This is easily one of the best among several restaurants that have come up in the vicinity in recent times. The decor is funky and cozy. The star discovery from my visit here was 'Guava Tini'. This cocktail is made with vodka, guava juice and tobasco sauce and secret masala... It's spicy as well as heady and is one of the BEST cocktails I have ever had. Thump Your Feet, another vodka based cocktail that we tried was average. Gondhoraj Fish Tikka is easily one of the best dishes on the menu and is a must order item if you are visiting here. Dry Roasted Chilli Pork too was good. As we asked for the bill we were presented with a complementary chocolate salami made of chocolate and cashew and drizzled with chocolate sauce... it was rich, sinful and yummy! I would surely visit here again and again and 'Guava Tin' will always remain on my order list... Hic hic happy!!",positive

5325,"All the dishes were tasteless!
The paneer Butter masala was cooked with tadka dal and it looked like dal makhani with few pieces of paneer.
The Biriyani rice was of very low quality and salt was excess in the rice. We made one of the waiters taste it and even he said that salt was more in the rice.
Raita served along was watery with no thickness. Atleast use some curd and less water in the raita henceforth.
Mutton chaap was okayish in taste.
The fish kebab was raw and wasn't cooked properly.
Only thing that was good was the ambience.

Chanar kofta, and chingri malai curry and paanch foron murgi were perfectly upto the mark. Alongwith the dessert in the buffet, we also order nolen gurer icecream ( simply tastes heaven ) and baked sondesh. The aam porar shorbot was so-so.

Otherwise it was not okay,,
Suggestions : try add little bttr wo tht flavours can enhance,
Try not to choped the octopus bcz when customers order they will definitely want to fll the pice of octopus,

And the color of the momo was red,so i dont inow it was natural color or the food color...

Keep it up guys... I really like the menu. And 1more thing there was no role of the green chutny, and the green chutny was not at all tste good,there is lack of salt and the flavours,, but i like the taste of peanut..",negative
6732,"The menu needs to be updated because I was charged a bit more than what is mentioned here. Tried their non veg combo. The veg combo mentioned here wasn't even there on their Menu Card which they handed me. The Litchi Iced tea and Chocolate Tart were great, although I didn't find anything of substance in the non veg sandwich. Its pretty much the one you can make at home, minus the chicken. (I hope you know what that means). A cozy place to hang out. The decor is okay. The staff was friendly.
FREE ADVICE:---The pizza is a really small one, the size of a normal piece of bread. Don't waste your money on that or the momo, which you can get for a lot cheaper at Wow Momo(and with a lot more flavour, which goes without saying).",negative

âï¸ Peri Peri Twistato

The peri peri twistato was very tasty and was worth the penny. But the other one didn't taste good.

Coming to the food, I was their with 3 of my friends and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian, Hot Garlic Chicken and Fried Chicken Momo. The rice was good, the chicken dishes was okaish as both the dishes tasted exactly the same but still it was tasty and the momo was good too but it was too much oily.

As per the portion I must say that is not quite good, I guess I have ordered Combo so that they have given a less quantity.

Recently ordered Egg Biryani from here, delivered hot in a paper box by Zomato on right time. Biryani rice seemed okey but not well mixed with spices and that didn't made it packed full of flavours.

Rannaghar(kitchen) is the place from where the journey of a food start getting it's shape, it's the place where the flavours are given a name, a heart & so, does RANNAGHAR, PARK CIRCUS, justifies the name?

Oh yes it does, atleast to me.

Being a food blogger, ratings hardly matter to me.
I just indulge myself into various sections of our food industry to taste their offering & surprisingly, rannaghar is what I came across last week.
It's rated 3.6 but their quality of food justifies the maintenance of hygiene.

Ordered for their chicken kosha meal, thanks to Zomato for the WOW50.

It consisted of rice(fine quality), dal(could've been better) with fries, soyabean curry(was spicy and tantalizing) with the ultimate CHICKEN KOSHA-and for surprise, I received two leg pieces, thanks for that.
Tasted amazing.
Nothing overdone with perfect play of spices.

The overall experience was great, nice packaging.

Chicken qorma is one of the star dishes.
All of the staff was very friendly and courteous. Service of momita was amazing, she served us very well and suggest us some good drinks and the best dishes to try from buffet.

So, today I am going to start my food journey from one of the new bornie in town namely âKurry N Kebabsâ located in GD block, salt lake sector 3, Kolkata. The slogan justifies it really well âSmall place BIG TASTEâ. Regarding the ambiance, I find it very cozy and quite spacious with least sitting arrangement. But if we compare the food quality, itâs literally awesome. I must say itâs a gem in a town that serves the best cuisine in Keralian style.

What i liked:nice ambiance.
Food is scrumptious and the quantity is good.(although we got to try the soup only)
What i disliked: service. We waited for 35 mins to get a seat and more 30 mins to get the food served although only soup. Because the staffs were busy attending the reserved section.
So we had to leave starving.
Conclusion: Am absolutely disappointed by their service.
I won't recommend this place.",negative

We were a group of three being served by a tall thin man ( unfortunately donât have the name as they do not wear name tags )
1.Our plates were being removed even before we were done with our food. 
2. No one was coming to clean the table after being repeatedly asked. 

The excuses were even more annoying. 
The wall should first train their waiters to understand table manners, and understand the basics, in serving diners. 
Would not recommend this restaurant at all, purely because of the service.

My blog is based upon numerous visits I had to this place and each and every time I had an amazing experience.
The interiors are done in a very simple way, the lighting is done in an artistic way. Everything with decor and interior is just perfect, not overdone or underdone too. The Coastal Macha can accommodate 50-55 heads, space is huge inside.

Must try tandoori devilled crab, malabarÂ paratha, mutton ghee roast and tender coconut pudding.

The best combination of all time & a perfect bliss for me.

So,
Mutton Biryani - The biryani was quite light, well balanced flavors , non oily and most importantly delicious. The mutton pieces were succulent too..it was worth it for me.

Chicken Chaap - meat was juicy, tender and perfectly coocked. This dish successfully satisfied my taste buds.

So we orederd chicken laduni kebab,chicken kassa as it was suggested to be spicy and tandoori rotis.
Served faster then a lot of other restaurants in town the kebab was juicy enough and well balanced.
The chicken kassa and roti too was good but I loved the kebab the most.

Chicken Fritters was pretty good as starter recommendation, tosted with salsa sauce.

2268,"â Location: Purnadas Road, Hindustan Park
â Type: Online Delivery
â Cuisine: Chinese

We ordered-

*Korean Fried Rice: This special Fried rice has a mixture of both sweet and salty flavours. Soya Sauce seems to be the primary ingredient of the dish. The seasonings though strong, the vegetables and meats are nice, fresh and juicy.Â 
*Chicken Prawn Hakka Noodles: The prawns are big and juicy, the chicken is deep-fried and a bit chewy. A bit oily than usual, yet the noodles are thick and flavourful.
*Bhetki in Chilli sauce: Bhetki fish was encased in a thick batter of cornflour. The fish though fresh and succulent; could hardly be enjoyed due to the heavy covering. The Chilli sauce is not-so-hot and plain, which is most enjoyable for non-spicy eaters.

The food quality and quantity is sufficient for 3-4 people. The cost is reasonable too. Must try for a modified Chinese preparation.

10794,"It's an very old restaurant in New market area which is famous for its family cabin system of sitting arrangements and for its Kavirajis and Cutlets.
I had ordered the following
*Chicken biriyani
* Chicken kaviraji

The taste of the biriyani was descent enough and the kaviraji was served with potato waffers and salad. However they take really long in serving afte because it remains heavily crowded throughout the year.",negative

7655,"It is a best place for budget pepole. They served good quantity food in a very economical price & also maintain their quality of food. I have visited their many times. Every time I was feeling satisfied with their food. They also served fast food & their egg roll is very famous in sodepur area. Biriyani is also famous for big chicken/ mutton piece but personally I don't like the taste of their biriyani. Because no body can't beat Dada Boudi in Biriyani segment.

Provide food quantity is low and quality not great.
Quality is not great compared with the rate chart.
Food delivery by foil container, not provide any good container.
Food Packaging is very bad, should be improved.",negative

1702,"I opted for a home delivery service and the food was delivered to me, pretty quickly.
I had ordered for:
âï¸ Chicken Burger
âï¸ Crispy Chicken
âï¸ French Fries
âï¸ Chicken Strips
âï¸ Cold Drink

The quality of the burger was inferior. However, the crispy chicken and the strips were decent.
French fries were extremely dry. The cold drink was sealed properly and there was no spillage.
The food overall lacked some decent taste. Lack of spices in the food.",negative
9959,"Well the area near Diamond Plaza mall is slowly turning into a food lovers paradise and Kasturi is just another addition to it. Went for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon and opted for classic Bengali main course like chingri maach er malai kari and sorse pomfret and I would say I didn't expect the food to be so tasty. Everything was fresh and hot and everything came to our table pretty fast. 
The only thing which lacks in this joint is the lack of decent service.. The attendants were grumpy and sleepy and they lacked any kind of interaction whatsoever. There were times when I was alone in the restaurant and none of the attendants were present in the dining area. 
The restaurant will do great in future solely because of the quality of food they serve and it would be an added advantage if they can take the service seriously. Because when one goes to eat out not only food but the quality of service also matters a lot.",negative

But on our first visit to the place, we were highly shocked and impressed at the same time, by the mesmerizing artistic creation shown in the decor. Be it the decor, the food, or the staff, it'll surely fill the mind with positivity. The place is like a perfect place for hangout with its light music and attractive paintings and crafts. We tried tandoori chicken pizza, chicken nachos and brownie shake. Food was more than delicious and worth trying again and again. The owner was very polite as well and was very attentive to the customars opinion. I'm quite sure that nobody would want to miss this place.",positive

The portion is ample, and most of the times you get to choose your piece of meat, and if available they give what you want. The quality of rice is good, soaked in flavor and the meat is tender and succulent. Best part is that if you are not in mood for biryani you may settle down with plain rice, dal and sabzi with fish curry, or any other non veg curries.

1256,"âWhen it comes to CIT cafe I have such fond memories. This is one place I've been coming since I was a kid. Over the years many things changed, like their interiors and the staff.. but what remains the same is the taste of their food . Their's is one of the best Chinese food served in and around Central Kolkata. Be it the Hot and Sour Chicken Soup, the Pepper ChickenÂ  , the Crispy Chilli Babycorn, the Shanghai Chicken or their Noodles. If you have kids with you or people who do not like spicy food, then Lemon Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken is for you! You can always end your meal with a bowl of either Tutti Frutti or Chocolate Sundae. It's always a nice experience to visit CIT Cafe!",positive

The size of the momos is the first thing I noticed!!It was the size of my palms!!Each Momo had perfect amount of delicious and juicy filling!
The stuffing that was made for the pork momos had the authentic taste intact!! Recommended.
The deep fan fried momos came slathered in a lipsmacking sauce.
Both the momos were accompanied with a bowl of clear soup which was quite bland to be honest.
The service was prompt.

Noteworthy mentions are Thakurbarir Chicken Pulao,Mutton Biryani and Chicken Chaap.

The foods were all good but the Banspora Chicken was the BEST! Its taste is so unique. The Prawns were tender, juicy and perfectly cooked with mild flavours. The Patropora Mutton was also juicy and tasty but it could have been cooked a little bit more. The Wild Red Rice tasted good and was a nice pair to the Banspora Chicken. The Malyasian Seafood Rice could have been given a bit more attention cause the taste was a bit off for me but still nice. And finally, the Squid was a also a Star; crisp on the outside and a bit chewy on the inside, the taste was quite to my liking!

5. Chilli Panneer
6. Tandori Roti

10318,"As the name suggest XD haha.. it serves all types of cuisine.. The place is really small hardly two group of 6 and few couples could fit in.. I was very hungry and wanted some food that would fill my tummy.. I orders the egg fried rice and chilly chicken combo.. Trust me quantity was very very nice , I think two people can easily feed in it. Coming to the taste I find it pretty average, felt the rice was not properly cooked, and the chicken was also average. I hope You guys would take care of the quality other than that it was not a bad experience.. small dine are perfect here.",negative

Virgin mojito- 4/5
Kitkat Shake- 3.5/5
Nachos- 5/5
Veg Stroganoff- 5/5
Cheese Jalepenos Poppers- 5/5
Mixed Sauce Spaghetti- it was good but wayy too thick in consistency. So you might wanna be specific before ordering about the ratios of white and red sauces. I think mine had a greater amount of white sauce in it.
Spaghetti Pomodoro- 3.5/5. It was kinda sweet in taste
Dahi ke kebab- 3/5
From their Indian Menu we had tried-
Butter naan, Masala kulcha, Malai Kofta, Paneer Tikka Masala- all were good.

Maa ordered the pagla mamar biriyani, she was elated by the mutton pieces , she says they were melt in the mouth and the rice was flavoured with âpaanch foron â and made in butter I think , so very different. But a good choice .
The ghatshila chicken was spicy and hot! A great combination, the gravy was very flavourful.

Coming to the food, I have ordered biryani, of course. And it was beyond my expectation. Rice was super fine, perfectly mixed with spices. Two big chunks of chicken pieces were there. And the mighty 'potato', which a Bengali will never compromise with, was really well-cooked and soft. It was served with a small bowl filled with raita and ring onions.

Here to mention that there are options for personalizing your order like adding one chicken piece or two pieces of potato etc, which are totally unique and first-time for me.

Definitely an overhyped eatery.

P.S. Please hire professional,trained,well mannered staffs as the staffs in the waiting area are very impolite which makes them unprofessional.They should learn professionalism from the professionals of 5 & 7 star hotels.Being in the hospitality industry is not everyone's cup of tea.",negative

11149,"Went there on a Wednesday evening couple of weeks back and ordered thai soup , lemon crispy chicken , mushroom pepper salt , special mixed rice , chilly fish dry, special hakka noodles and kung pao chicken. The taste of the soup was good. But the quantity was small. The lemon crispy chicken was fried way too much and was having almost biscuit like consistency which I was not in agreement with. The pepper salt mushroom was again a tad too much fried. The rest of the items were at best okay. The portion size is meagre though especially for the starters. Nonetheless the service was good , ambience was not bad and that is that. It is a little overpriced considering the quantity and quality of food served. Given a choice I would anyday go to hatari for a better pocket pinch to gastronomical satisfaction ratio.",negative

Quantity to food in lasagnia was more that enough but I felt the quantity was less in mutton roast and lamb steak compare to the price they are charging for it. I felt sauteed vegetable was really less with steak and roast we ordered. But I loved he laste for food. Quantity should be increase if they are charging this much.

Once inside, the surroundings are cramped. All these are compensated by the food though. Ordered the 555 Thali. The welcome drink, Lebu Lonka was appreciable. The starters and the main course were served simultaneously, which is a bit surprising. All the items were superbly and freshly cooked. Although several items could be repeated as part of the deal, the first serving was so substantial that one doesn't really needs to repeat anything. Of special mention is the prawn malai curry, the mutton curry, the fish cutlet and the chicken paturi.

8817,"I have been ordering from this restaurant since their early days, so pretty much all their popular dishes like Biryani, Chicken Tandoori, noodles, prawn curries, chicken chaanp, momos and other Chinese dishes.
The quality, I'll admit, has gone down markedly in comparison to the early days.
But it's still the only decent go-to option considering the locale. The staffs are friendly and the decor is simple yet elegant.
The quantity of any dish of Have More is to swear by. Even a plate of momo can become your dinner, as it comes with 8 huge pieces and a large bowl of broth.
Tandooris are quite good, though the meat can be a little more tender.
The Chinese side dishes are a disappointment, as all of them taste more or less the same, albeit with minor variations. It's better to stick to all the Indian dishes and just noodles.",positive
3337,"Went here for lunch in a huge group. We ordered for biriyanis, mixed gravy noodles, mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles, garlic chicken, chilli chicken, mutton kasha, rotis, nuns, salad.

Most of their preparations are delicious but somehow, the biryani lacks the punch for me. I used to work in this area and have had my share from here many times along with some of the other biryani joints as well.

It didn't took much time to deliver the food and the packing was really good and the delivery was done with care. As I opened the packet I realised that the quantity is more than most of the shops as in that price. The chili chicken was well cooked I realised that the chili chicken is not what we always eat but it was spicy and the fried rice was really cooked. At this price I must say that the quality and the quantity both are good.",negative

11015,One of the high end Indian restaurants on the park Street belt. A hidden gem to be honest. Lovely kebabs and main courses on offer. Would recommend the kebab platter here. Prices are steep but hey if you see the decor and ambience I would be ok paying a bit higher for it. Mocktails could be revamped out a bit. It's kinda cliche for me. The menu is vast diverse and authentic. Good place and a must try.,positive
7756,"Well this CCD is indeed a very good ambience in all aspect. Now come every aspect-
First of all the place is just opposite to Gitanjali Metro Station, if you come from garia bus stand you may walk for that for enjoying afternoon. And very close from Naktala Udyan Sangha you may visit here at the time of pujo hopping.

Secondly, The ambience is looking nice. The staff behavior is so good. Service is perfectly all right. We ordered A King Size Coffee, one Egg Wrap and a combo of A cup of coffee and Chiken Wrap.

Last but not the least....The tatse of food is just awesome. Personally I don't like the Egg Wrap and that is just waste of money...Yea it is true CCD is few costly it is not in poket pinch.
But the combo is ok you enjoy the food the chiken wrap and coffee is so good you must enjoy the cappuccino.

You must enjoy the day over a cup of coffee...",positive

5185,"What better way to start your lazy Sunday mornings, than with this special coffee at Hotel Homely Raj or Raj restaurant as it is popularly known in the Locality. Known for it famous dosas and other south Indian delicacies, this place is usually crowded during the breakfast hours. 
Considering the sizes of the dosas, i'd say get 1 dosa for two people, if you do not want to start your day with a really heavy stomach. I visited with my family and got the cheese masala dosa, plain masala dosa and the puri. But highlight of the breakfast was this coffe at the end. It is advertised in their indoor screen as ""Dancing Coffee"" because u can see the swirling milk interact with the dark coffee beneath. But beware, it is twice the normal shot of a coffee. So it is better split between two people. And look out for the milk foam on the top, scoop it up and try to taste with your tongue. 

P.S. it was my papa's recommendation. I didn't expect this to be such a good experience.",positive

Thereâs nothing much to describe about the ambiance. Itâs inspired from Londonâs 10 Downing Street. Very classy indeed.
Coming to food we went for their Chinese platter which had chilli fish, chicken wings, fried wanton and dry chilli chicken. All of them tasted equally amazing. We ordered peri peri baby corn too. It came with lip smacking mayonnaise. Batter was light and airy and the corn was cooked really well. We went for a Long Island ice tea also which shook me to be honest. After that I was literally flying.
Giving 5 to any place is really a big deal for me itâd have been a four, however they surprised us with a fried ice cream with a magic candle on it. I loved that touch. Amazing place worth of more visits.",positive

Their ambience is nice and located at a quite and calm area. A good place to visit with freinds or family based on ambience.
Coming to food, first of all they have very less options in all the varieties. You dont have much to choose. We were in a group of 6 people hence got a chance to try most of the items from their offered menu. Dosas are okay, not good not bad. The taste is average. Sambhar is nice but their coconut chatni can be made much better. Vada is much below average. We had ordered only two vadas for 6 people yet that was difficult to finish. Idli is fine again, not good, not bad. We ended with filter coffee which was good both in quantity and quality wise. Overall our experience in food was not upto the mark.

Mughlai Paratha (2.5/5) :
---------------------------------------------------
Paratha was delivered in plastic container with rich red potato curry in foil pack. Potato curry tasted very very tangy. Mughlai pieces was big and fully stuffed. But it felt bit soggy and felt like it was fried way before placing the order. Inside stuffing was absolutely dry & hard that made it taste very odd.

Otherwise ambience, food quality was very nice. They also sell Bengali sweets, snacks at the outside of the restaurant. The car parking space is quite big so, do not worry about parking.

Vegetarian pulao was very rich. It made with sallow fried vegetables, and served with cashew nuts, raisins on top of it.

Now my question is since chicken is white meat it can change into any colour but red but properly cooked !! To confirm my doubt I verified with the friend accompanying me who as well agreed to my point !

This place is pathetic and also they overcharge for everything on their menu.Some items were even more expensive than, some reputed cafe in town.
My friend and I had settled for a cup of chocolate-coffee each after scanning the whole menu.The coffee seemed great to the eyes ,but did not taste good at all. Don't even get close to the space if you have hygiene concerns.
Or rather stay away at any cost and save yourself from a truck load of regret and wasting some money.

Nestled on the first floor, we entered into a dimly lit, welcoming restaurant, setting the theme of old Asian feeling. The staffs were quite courteous and attentive. Soft music were playing in the background, setting the mood. Coming to food, we ordered one Wok Hot Wings and one Pho (pork). Each of the items were lip smacking and delicious! The hot wings had us licking our fingers and licking off the plate too! And the Pho was such a light,healthy yet tasty lunch...soupy noodles (rice noodles) with pork and assortments. Price range is quite reasonable! Definitely dropping by again and again!!

Absolutely loved the cold coffee and pepperoni pizza but the fish n chips was a huge disappointment. It was basically a beer batter fried fish instead of the classic fish n chips I love and come to understand from the name. Also the amount of beer is so much in the dish that the smell and bitterness of the beer overpowers the taste of the fish. The only edible part of this dish were the potato wedges. So, it was a mixed bag. Hope they work on their not so good dishes.",negative

I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and had an awesome time.
We sat downstairs first and then when the rain stopped we were shifted to the rooftop.So basically got an idea of both their seating arrangements.
We ordered Blue lagoon, spaghetti in white sauce,fish n chips, Amritsari Fish,and Afghani chicken.
The drink is my all time favorite.
The pasta was delicious but lacked the right amount of seasoning..but with a little bit of oregano and chilli flakes on top...it was just right.
The kababs were simply lipsmacking!!!We enjoyed it with two cans of Ginger Ale. Recommended.
The fish and chips were decent.

this is quite an economical place to order food from so here are the items which i ordered -

2. Fish Fingers - very strategically priced 4 for 80 , the taste is nice..

3. Mutton Chop - One of the items which i liked the most.. mutton chop was very nice and flavourful

4. Special Mughlai Parantha - It ruined everything , everything about it was bad , it was too oily , it was too salty , the filling was not tasty , the alu sabji which accompanied was not tasty either .

3992,"Went here during the pujas. We ordered brownie shake and green apple mohito. I really don't know if it was for the puja rush or something else, the brownie shake sucked. It felt like I was having chocolate shake and there was no brownie in it. They just gave some brownie which I felt were just plain chocolate cake for garnishing at the top. I was disappointed and pissed because they charged 180 rupees and gave this. The green appple mohito was still okay. But I have had much better green apple mohito n brownie shakes at other cafes which I can name as well.

The interior is good. It's a cozy place n is decorated nicely. The space is utilised properly.

If it's just for the Pujo time then I can excuse there lacking, but not visiting here again.

A note of advice for the cafe is that if you are charging such a huge amount then make sure you provide food of that level because I have had these in other places and trust me, they tasted much much better n are much lesser in price.",negative

2293,"Firstly, this rating is solely given on the basis of buffet spread on a particular day. The ambience and service is not questioned. I don't know about ala carte menu.

There were two types of soup (1 veg, 1 non veg), four types of starters (2 veg, 2 non veg), six types of main course ( noodles, rice, 2 types of veg gravy, chicken and fish items), typical desserts (brownie, darshan, 3types of icecream).

The spread looks fine within the price range but what is disappointing is the repetitive taste. The gravy of all the main course items tastes similar with slight altercation which does not surprise your taste buds. After one time you do not feel like eating anything new and everything gets bland. I felt the spread was over hyped to be honest. But I really do want to visit again for their ala carte menu.

CHICKEN PASTA IN WHITE SAUCE was delicious!
and
BBQ CHICKEN was also sooooo good. ð
@ just Rs. 64 only (each) .

Both of the items are a MUST TRY.

Service was prompt.

Would love to explore their more items soon.
Highly recommended. âð»",positive

4291,"Location: A little difficult to find, in a lane opposite the crossing of ice skating ring, Would not fall on your eyes at a stroke.
Ambience: Quite the style of a mumbai local train but the lighting is near dim with big paintings on the wall and comfy iron sitting. The rail handle s and the wheel lights add to it.
Food: Ordered a crispy corn as starter followed by a malai paratha, a churchura paratha and a pudina paratha with a paneer tikka masala.
Our beverages rolled into something fun were the alcohol containing gola s of Kala khatta and lime flavor.
The corn was like perfect to taste followed by the yummy parathas, the yummiest of them was the pudina one which was almost like a naan. The Malabar paratha was like layer by layer of ghee and pretty heavy to eat. The paneer dish was sufficient for 3 of us.
The golas were majestically awesome, specially the kala khatta.
Seamless zomato gold. Although service was top notch, they charged extra 5% service charge over the gst.",negative

9130,"Green Valley is a reliable restaurant with good food, great service and reasonable price. Being the only good restobar in the area, it is a good option to enjoy some drinks with snacks. 

Food

The strength of Green Valley in terms of food is definitely their tandoori which go very well with drinks. The tandoori pomfret which is cooked to perfection is the best followed by tandoori chicken and chicken Rashmi kebab. Try these and you will be happy. 

Ambiance and service 

The ambiance is nothing special but the service is fantastic. You also get complimentary chakhna here with drinks. 

Cost

â¹ 200-300 for food. Drinks are served in 30 and 60 ml pegs and the cost differs depending on what you drink. 

Verdict 

Recommend",positive

11231,"What a joke!!! The average cost for 2 persons  is being shown as 300. For that each person needs to have atleast 3 of the chicken and cheese burgers. Please correct this part. 
As for the quality...you get excellent value for money. 
Just one suggestion. In the chicken and cheese burger please add 1 cheese slice instead ofbthe cheese sauce...this would make the burger much more  tastier. Still.....the quality of burger they provide at this cost is unmatchable.",positive

5491,"I'm utterly disappointed with the delivery process of zomato. I ordered two chicken biryani.But after 30mins when nobody from Zomato picked up my order I called to the restaurant.The worker who very politely told me that delivery boys are on strike so no one is picking up my order. No my point is if delivery boys are not available why did zomato enable the delivery option? When I tried to cancel my order through the chat they were saying u should know we can't cancel the order. Ok that's fine. But neither zomato delivering it to me nor cancelling it.Then what should I do?
Although the restaurant itself rejected the order.And thanks for that.

For the food and behaviour the restaurant gets 5 points.
But Zomato app gets -5 points. I would never ever order anything through zomato.Because this is d 2nd time I had faced problems regarding the delivery.

Later I went to the restaurant,ordered biryani and brought my parcel.
Biryani of this place is my all time favorite.",positive

8329,"I ordered here through Zomato delivery. The food reached well within time. Nowadays fried chicken outlets are in every corner, but most of them are below average if you keep them at par with KFC. But the food from here was way better than those from other outlets. Here i found the chicken to be perfectly crispy and the chicken was with skin (Which is very important when you are making fried chicken).

Two cons are -

1. Chickens were a bit too spicy (as in more use of cayenne or red chilli)

2. A bit over fried.

That's all folks, until next time.. :)",positive

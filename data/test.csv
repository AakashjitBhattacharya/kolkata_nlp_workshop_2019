25,"This place has been on my list for quite some time. The ambience is great. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The rooftop, live music, jacuzzi are the plus points of this place. The cocktails are great. But if you're here for the food that could be a disappointment. The non-veg dishes were not really up to the mark and could have been better.",positive
37,What a wonderful cold winter evening it was. My Husband‚Äôs birthday it was. We enjoyed the ambience as much as we enjoyed the variety of food. Each item was extremely tasty. Loud music set the mood for evening.,positive
49,"BabBQ had always been a personal favorite when it came to having Chinese delicacies (rather Indian version of Chinese). But this time my expectations somehow went for a toss, maybe it was just this particular occasion (hopefully).

We had,
1. Crispy babycorn (5/5)
2. Drums of Heaven (5/5)
3. Chilli garlic chicken noodles (3/5)
4. Mixed fried rice (4/5)
5. Ginger garlic chicken (4/5)- I felt this was a bit too sweet.",positive
60,"Know for its Deep Dish Pizza this place is surely worth the visit.We ordered vegetarian dishes only.To start with we ordered ‚ÄúPinacolada‚Äù which was excellent and it‚Äôs a must order.Next came Mozzarella Sticks from Appetiser section which tasted average and is not at all value for money.One should better skip this.Finally we had their signature ‚ÄúHot Blazing Deep Dish Pizza‚Äù which tasted amazing and is different from the regular pizza.The outer and upper portion is crispy which makes it different from other pizzas.The salt content was less in both the items which can be improved.

The place is spacious and Service is good.Prices are on the higher side.",negative
69,"Ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani, Awadhi Dum Aloo and Butter Naan from Zomato.
Will love to give a detailed rating for the Biryani and the Awadhi Dum Aloo
‚Ä¢ Awadhi Handi Biryani- 4.6/5. Only word ""delicious""! Aah! What a taste! The quality as well as the quantity was too good. It's perfect for two people. It contains mutton pieces and two eggs and raita. Only thing we missed in the Biryani was the ""Aloo"".
‚Ä¢ Awadhi Dum Aloo- 4.5/5. This is a unique dish we tried. This dish serves two potatoes stuffed with cottage cheese and dry fruits!",positive

101,"The biryani rice is perfect. Moist and fluffy.¬†Spectacular authentic, Kolkata-like biryani. ¬†The biryani, being a namesake as well, is their signature dish. I haven‚Äôt tried their Chicken biryani and but the¬†Mutton biryani is absolutely spectacular. This is a no frills, straight up tender meats, soft rice, and spices that don‚Äôt overwhelm place to eat. ¬†I tried the Mutton and plenty of meat and rice to share with 2 people and the goat was oh so tender. But I am capable enough to have it all. A Biryani lover by heart.¬†The biryani were delicious with great flavor mixed with just the right amount of oil and the Mutton pieces were cooked to perfection. The amount was quite fulfilling.",positive

it was average allover. tikka size was abysmally small.but u cant expect much in that price. biriyani i liked but the chicken piece was weird inside. it made me off.",negative
145,This is really a very old name when it comes for biryani. Near barrakpore station the place has a very little capacity. Ambience is not good at all but as per the taste is concern it's above all. We tried their mutton as well as chicken biryani. A must visit place for all biryani lovers.,positive
171,"Went to Saffron Tree on a winter afternoon. A very well decorated place. To go with the name, they have a yellowish-orange theme. For starters we ordered, J.M.B.C. and Orange and sun dried tomato murg tikka. J.M.B.C. had a buttery-cheesy taste. I loved it! ‚ù§Ô∏è Lucknowi dum biryani was okayish in taste.",positive
179,"Went two months back to ds legendary place.

199,"Hoppipola's Ambiance was really nice. The drinks are good & food was tasty. I also liked the track that was being played in the background. We ordered LIIT pitcher as well as pizza. Overall the food & drinks were good. However, the staff was very rude and bossy. She apologized afterwards but, I don't think in a Food & Beverage Industry, you shouldn't be bossy on your customers. We're guided to a wrong table and it seems it has been reserved for bunch of people, but then she should have politely asked us to go to a different table. Bossing around us & speaking rudely as if we have come there to get free drinks shouldn't be the attitude. ( I perceived from her tone). Was a good experience other than that.",negative
200,"i have never been tired of going Tandoor House as it provides quality mughlai cuisine in the most budget-friendly way in the town.i have tried almost every item of their menu.and truely though these are not the best in the city but obviously good in comparison of cheaper prices.
The ambience is pretty organised with some antiques and dimly lit sitting arrangement.
which i love the most here are as following-

1)-Chicken /Mutton biriyani combo-
it costs only 155rs.but belive me it is very sufficient to fill one hungry tummy.this combo consists of one mutton biriyani(one piece aloo and dim also),two piece of chicken tikka/reshmi kabab along with chicken butter masala.

2)Badshahi pulao combo-
my another favourite.

3)Mutton kasha and tandoori nan

So guys , if your tummy is craving for more and more do come here.grab more not giving pressure to your pocket.",positive
206,all foods are extremely pocket friendly and taste is quite ok...i tried chicken maharaja and that was little bit spicy but taste is good and in the place of combo item biriyani was tasty but the chicken chap was not that up to the mask..but parcell pakageing is very impressive......,positive

225,"It's a very happening place. Try not to follow Google Maps to get there. Instead, head towards Ojas, just opposite Porsche Showroom in Topsia. The bar is on the rear side of this building.
We got a comfy seat and ordered four craft beers. Eskar was definitely the best, even better than Caldera.
Kiwi sheesha was mild, and added to the experience. Four seasons pizza was a bliss. The basil leaf topping did the trick.
The ambience was nice. They played some nice music, and the staff was rather courteous. The waiters actually wait upon you and linger close. Although this is helpful initially, it also hinders a natural conversation. I was catching up on a friend, so asked him not to wait on us any longer.
Other than that, it was a very nice experience.",positive
252,"It's been in my bucket list for a very long time and finally in puja I visited this high rated restaurant with my family. Decor is very much impressive, stuffs are well behaved and they help you with the dishes. As it was puja, limited dishes were available.
We ordered
1) Beer can tempura fish
2)Dajaj chermaula
3) Baked Wellington
4) Moon faan/Nasi gorang(don't remember)
5) Chicken in chilli oyster and mashrooms
All the food items are extremely tasty and quantity is also sufficient. And one more thing should be appreciated is the way they present all their dishes, they are attractive.
Would love to visit again to try other dishes and it is a must visit for all who lives in Kolkata!

262,"This place was there in my bucket list for quiet a long time so, finally went there and the ambiance of the place kept my excitement intact. Moreover the rooftop location of this place is so apt that anyone would love to visit.¬†
Now talking about the sitting arrangement they have this really cool swing kinda place for 4 people which is so cool and interesting. We sat there and enjoyed the evening with lovely music on.
Staff were really good and apt with service.. They were cordial with any info we asked them for.

We ordered the Following:
‚úî Smoked Fried BBQ Wings

264,"Awesome place in the middle of the city with amazing views of the skyline! Roof top experiences are beautiful anyways but I really liked the ambience and the setups. The weather contributed of course. 
Had gone for a wine and cheese party on the topmost level and was amazed and impressed at the beautiful spread laid out. In Kolkata it‚Äôs difficult to come across good  Sangria but I loved it here! Accompanied by chips, dips, variety of cheese, olives and fruits the table was a sight to behold and heaven to taste... 
Recommend trying the mushroom cheese balls.. if you‚Äôre a mushroom lover you can‚Äôt miss these! 
Pizza and Spagetti were done just right. 
The presentation of the food and the platters are worth a mention too. 

Definitely worth coming back to!",positive
275,"A MUST TRY DISH FROM BESSTOO. just like their KARACHI CHICKEN BIRYANI, THIS CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI IS ALSO JUST FAB. Though i like this tikka biriyani bit better than karachi biriyani.
All the pieces were bone less, well marinated, juicy, tender. Flavour of the well cooked rice was awesome.
And beside these biriyani they always provide RAITA and this raita is one of the best raida i ever had.
And not only this biriyani guys just try their normal DAL items and some SABJI.Trust me those all were like home made.
AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THEIR CHICKEN BHARTA. you will love it. Shredded chicken and small chunks of chicken all these dipped in kaju made gravy, makes this dish the best(according to me)
Now a days not a single restaurant thinks about customer satisfaction and quality. But MR. PRASUN CHANDA and his team always care about quality and their customer satisfaction. Thank you BESSTOO.",positive
283,"Besstoo is a delivery outlet which serves Bengali, North Indian and Chinese. Heard lot many times about their good quality of food and finally I got a chance to try their food.

Tried their Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chap, this is one of the best combinations which hardly goes wrong and Besstoo made sure that our experience with them be lip-smacking good. The biriyani was light with balanced flavours and the portion oc meat was also good; the chicken chap was also as per my expectation, succulent chicken piece with that creamy gravy.

My first try went really well, hoping to order soon again.

It was a mixed group and we ordered different dishes mix of chinese, indian, tandoori and continental. For starters we had Fish in Housing sauce and Murgh reshmi kebab. The fish was very tasty cooked with perfect of sauces. Then we ordered pizza, thin crust and with generous toppings of chicken.
Main course was dynamic for us, with mixed rice and kung pao chicken, nan and chicken makhani, pasta in white sauce, lamb steak and baked pomfret. So all the dishes were equally good, however the stand out was the chicken makhani and the lamb steak. The decor is quite nice with a mix of high stools and normal tables. At the time went they did not have the alcohol license so were only serving mocktails with a quite a few options. To me it's one of the best multi cuisine restaurant in town right now.",positive

Nevertheless, a nice place to fill your stomach within budget.",positive
480,"Absolutely delicious, wholesome momos. I love this place and I'm glad they have opened quite a few outlets. I already love their steamed momos.

Loved the ambience with a soft music playing.

Coming to the food we had ordered Cream of Soup(Chicken), Virgin Mojito, Kit Kat Shake and Peri peri chicken for the main course.

The Virgin Mojito was a bit more salty though we had ordered sweet. Other items were really delicious. The quantity of the shake and mocktails were more than enough for two people. The Peri Peri chicken was served with buttered rice, vegetables and a sauce. The chicken was soft and we'll prepared.

The bill for all these was around Rs700 which is quite reasonable and affordable.

None of the items that were offered on the menu tasted awesome on my taste buds. We had ordered chicken ghee roast and a dish from fish side. Alongwith that the kukum mocktail. In the main course was bamboo biryani, lava gosht, bakhar khani and a chicken dish. However none of them could tantalise my taste buds.

I have been there a few times and what I tried are as follows

‚Ä¢ Chicken Szechwan fried rice
‚Ä¢ Chicken rice noodles
‚Ä¢ Thai chicken

Both the fried rice and rice noodles tasted good. Two dish is enough for three people to share along with a side. Thai chicken didn't have thai flavours yet was good to taste. I guess there were 12/15 pieces of chicken in full plate. I was satisfied with this dish .

The place was really crowded however we managed to grab a window seat.
Ordered a murg musallam, a special mutton biriyani and a special chicken biriyani. It had a full chicken roasted in spices, an egg, a potato and a tomato.
Murg musallam was spicy and huge in quantity.. It was really good in taste. The chicken biriyani had an egg, a potato and two good pieces of chicken..
However, the mutton pieces were not up to the mark and we asked to change it.. But they seemed pretty reluctant to do so. The quantity of rice seemed less too.

773,"So a sudden plan late at night for something tasty to munch on with a friend who was leaving town. We ordered:

Coriander & Chilly Mushroom: This was a pure delicacy. The mushrooms were coated and fried. Then they were tossed with capsicums and coriander.

Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo: This was a little different from the traditional tandoori Aloo. It had a stuffing of spices and dry fruits. So the hot of the tandoori spices was toned down with the mint yoghurt dip and the sweetness from dry fruits.

The staff is amazingly courteous and they are well versed with the menu. Overall a great experience.",positive
790,"Amazing place with quality service. Dinner was overall amazing. Tried the book choy dimsums, fried prawns, spicy caramelized pork (my favourite), crab, basil rice and the outstanding desserts.

The chicken korma too was delicious and contained chicken, egg and a huge potatoe for single plate.the let down was there was no mint chutney or onions lime or chillies that ususally accompany such foods.

Yesterday finally got the chance to try their Biryani. Honestly was not expecting much but was surprised with the taste. The Biryani tasted great and the chicken piece was spicy with all its spices intact. Usually the steaming process and the handling ends up with chicken losing its pre marinated spices somewhere in the rice. It was not the case here. Quantity was also sufficient. Definitely going back again.",positive

Ordered penne Alfredo pasta, chicken burritos and tiramisu cold coffee (because I love tiramisu). The pasta was quite saucy and I liked it. Burritos could have been less spicy but you might differ with me here. The cold coffee was an epitome of perfection.

The place has a nice South Kolkata feel (alternative decoration, tried to do something new, pulled it off, get it?) to it. Obviously, you are in South Kolkata already, but it confirms that you are, and sucks you right in.

1045,This is one of the new takeaway joints in the city. I ordered from this place. They serve north indian and mughlai dishes. Packaging is pretty good. The food was really hot when it arrived. Now coming to taste. The tandoori chicken was tender and juicy. All the pieces were nicely coated with spices. They served one mint chutney and a garlic chutney along with the tandoori. Garlic chutney was quite unique and flavourful. Mint chutney was okayish. Next coming to biriyani. The taste is quite similar to that of the kabuliwala biriyani. Biriyani is accompanied with raita and salad. Next we tried the plain nan and chicken kadai handi murg. It was listed as one of their bestseller. The chicken pieces were tender with big chunks of capsicum and onion in the gravy. Overall a nice experience. Will again order from this place soon.,positive

They also have dj nights every Saturdays and Sundays from evening.

We ordered Budweiser Magnum and their CLASSIC MURGH TIKKA.

The tikkas were big, juicy and nicely seasoned and it was going absolutely divine with strong beer.

We were served 6 big pieces of tikkas by the way.

Overall, had a great experience.
The staffs were also nice and cordial.

Plus, the washroom, it was a common one for changing clothes as well as the toilet. So, not at all convenient. One star down. View and all of the surroundings, that can be counted in.
Secondly, the food. Tasted good and all, and the drumsticks were finger licking as well, but they had pasta in their menu and on ordering it, we got spaghetti. That again got another star down.

2. Suufiyana special Murgh Hundi Lazeez: 4-5 pcs of chicken (small size) cooked in Nizami style flavoured rose water. The taste was mouth watering.

3. Suufiyana special Zaffrani Firni : It is very soft and tastes delicious.

The 3 cheese sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. It's grilled with butter which not only makes it crispy but you can also smell the butter when you take a bite. The cheese inside tastes great.

The Red Bean Burger tasted quite good too. I'm glad they went for a protein which isn't paneer. The patty is stuffed and it tastes light and good.

I wish they had eggless desserts in the menu. Also, I wish they didn't give chips and instead gave french fries with the sandwiches and burgers.

Overall a nice place. If you're in Rabindra Sadan and want to sit and relax, this seems like a good spot for it.",positive

The beer was simply amazing though!!The starters that we ordered were pan Fried chilli fish and crispy chicken.Both dishes somehow tasted the same!!!The food was on BOGO offer via zomato gold and the drinks were on BOGO too!!
Had a good beer with roasted flavour after quite long...The place could have been better organized.Looked shabby to me.The service wasn't up to the mark.

5 üåü for the polite courteous staffs, checked on us again n again
10 üåü for the Food, I never had this much succulent juicy yet properly cooked prawn before in any chinese dish. Schezwan Rice went perfect with this. We preferred for the less spicy schezwan, n they made it just as we wanted. Price was reasonable, it seemed more reasonable once we tasted the food. It does justice with quality and the quantity. Great Dining Experience, she was completely satisfied. And that made the whole evening worthwhile. Hidden *Gem* Go for it!",positive

2. Food quality Was so impressive. I did't have any of those main courses, but surely main courses are good too, because i was amazed to try some of those starters and snacks. I ate an egg chicken roll, and it was so amazing, even the upper crust of that laccha paratha was tender. Chicken, sauce and other ingredients all together made it sensational. 

3. Service was decent and swift.",positive

1402,"Parathey wali Gali
( a restaurant of Bon Apetite)

Splendid food and decor is what characterises this restaurant. A host of parathas, lassi s and side dishes to choose from adds to the magic. The decor is very creative and out of the box.

Waiting time is average. The restaurant is not very spacious though. 1 paratha is usually sufficient for 1, although I know a person who can eat 2 parathas frm here, at once.. They make the preparation so rich with cheese nd oil nd all, you cant eat more than 1.. the lozenge they give in the end is a reliever. It will reduce vomiting tendencies if any due to consumption of excessive cheese and helps in digestion. Overall a nice restaurant to go with your friends or spouse.

How to reach: Take a metro to kalighat station, move towards lake mall.. A gentle walk and few turns will take you there.
Google maps will help you. Its within walking distance. Happy eating !",positive

2. Naan Turnover stuffed with Chicken Bharta: This is going to be a special choice for all the non veg lovers. The stuffing is done by mouth watering chicken bharta. One piece is enough for a single person.",positive

My friends and I ordered a few of the dishes and tasted them. It had authentic flavours and tasted pretty good.
Dishes we tasted were:
Kung Pao sizzler
Rajma Chawal sizzler
Thai red curry sizzler
Mustard paneer chili sizzler

My favorite was Kung Pao. It was hot, spicy and full of flavors. I just couldn't stop eating that.

If you don't like spicy you can go for the Mustard Paneer Chilli sizzler, paneer was cooked to the perfect with a pungent taste of mustard the dish tasted quite well.
Ended the say with Sizzling Rabdi Jalebi wich was soulful and completed my meal.",positive
1501,"A really nice and little cafe that is located within the premises of the Russian Consulate or Gorky Sadan. It serves a range of continental dishes and starters. I specially went just to try out the Russian dishes on their menu and they didn't disappoint.
Probably the only place in the city that serves Russian food, I first ordered some chicken pelmeni which are chicken dumplings served with sour cream. These were light and full of flavours. Next I opted for a Chicken stroganoff which remains a popular dish in menus of most restaurants. This was well cooked as well. In the dessert , I had a sweet bliny which are Russian crepes stuffed with sweet cream and fruits which was a bit average . Otherwise it was really awesome to find out how Russian food tastes sitting here from Kolkata. Special mention for the members of the staff who were very courteous and helped me in choosing the dishes. They also have books to read, board games to play and many such options in their cafe.",positive

The packing was very average and that had let down my hopes a little bit but to my surprise when I tasted the Beef Bhuna, it was really good. The beef dishes in here are really good. However, the chicken dish didn't taste good at all. I felt as if too much of salt was added to it which completely ruined it's taste. Chicken dishes is a big no from here but beef dishes are something you wouldn't want to miss. Infact the restaurant is very much pocket friendly and is definitely not going to burn a hole in your pocket. :)",negative
1533,"Decided to try this place since it serves authentic Bengali food. Really liked the way they presented their menu. They got a serving tray filled with bowls showing the items they serve. After asking the captain for their signature dishes, decided to try their Bhetki Bhappa baked (Fish), Kochu Patta Chingri Bhappa (Prawns curry) 5/5 and Chicken Curry 4.5/5 (forgot the name since i couldnt remember the pronunciation and i lost the bill). The prawns and chicken curry were my favourite pick and I totally enjoyed it. Bhetki Bhappa (2.5/5) was baked fish which my belly didnt really like, it had an odd taste to it and was too oily and heavy. The captain said it was one of their authentic hot sellers. Overall, a must visit place while in New Market area.",positive

We ordered , mixed fried rice , pan fried chilly fish, spiced fish in hot garlic sauce, hakka noodles and mutton dak bungalow. Have to say the food quality was good and appetizing and the quantity was more than ample. But The mutton dak bungalow turned out to be the victor.

1601,Really loved the food and mock tails which one got here. The menu is extremely unique and it has great flavours as well.

We had ordered ""Zucchini Rollard with fresh vegetables served with herb rice"" (signature dish) which was nice.
For drinks we ended up with ""Cucumber basil thunder"" which was fresh and soothing and ""Icy spicy Guava"" which I didn't happen to like much.

Couch potatoes - It's nice mushy, and moderately spicy dish. It's a nice starter to start with , not my favorite though.

Made in china- I have to admit, everything in platter was just perfect and tasted extremely nice. Must try.

Desert- Choc-o-bloc volcano - this was my Favorite üíì the lava that bursted , the ice cream üíì im not a sweet tooth person, so if I liked it , it is definitely worth it.üíì

Coming to the food- as we dint have enough time so we concentrated on food only and we had herby chicken fingers, hawain grilled prawn and hungarian chicken . We also had refreshing chicken coriander soup. The chicken fingers were crispy outside and the marinated chicken strips were soft inside. The grilled prawns were medium sized 8pieces of prawn served with tartar sauce and grilled pineapple. Very unique and tasty it was. The hungarian chicken was basically cubes of chicken prepared in a mushroom sauce with bell peppers and mushroom. The experience was good and will surely visit in a larger group.",positive

2005,"The Chaiwala is a small cozy place, not very well decorated but serving the best food in the town in affordable prices. We ordered grilled chicken burger which is the most juicy and tasty burger I ever had. There are many options in burger menu. We had refreshing ice tea which was worth it's name and the lemon ginger tea. The waiter suggested a special dish probably called mozzarella chicken fritters, which was amazing. The orders came fast and service was very good. üíØ% recommended.",positive

The pizza size is good and it's in thin crust which is a good thing. The toppings are fresh and with lots of cheese. Taste is nice and crunchy. Go for it.,negative

It has 3 seating rooms and one room for the pets.
Yes Pets! You heard it right.
They have a room where there are dogs and you can have a chit chat with them(not literally). Isn't that amazing?
Coming to the food- The Chicken Lasagna was the best I've ever had. I've also had their Spicy Ginger Mocktail, Kit Kat Shake and Manchow Soup. The Soup is also one of my favourite.
Love the ambience.
There are board games too to indulge your time in.
Love this place.

2135,"I had ordered food from this joint. Hence, my review is fully on the basis of ordered food.
1. Chicken Wonton: 3/5 Nice and tasty, but contained way much coating as in comparison to stuffing.
2. Chicken Lat Mai Kai: 2.5/5 It was okayish. But could have tasted way better, if had ordered it from any other outlet.
3. Chicken Pepper Salt 1/5 It was hard and tasteless. Hated it. Not recommended.
Though saves a hole in your pocket, this outlet is bad af, for starters.
Not recommended.",negative

Both were nice. Then we had steamed rice, stuffed patal, aam kasundi ilish, daab chingri. The potol was cooked in a white sweet gravy and was very tasty. The daab chingri which I find bland in most places was very balanced and tasty here. The aam kasundi ilish was finger licking good. The piece of the ilish was also very satisfactory.",positive

3 star for that but the welcome was not as expected.

Garden Pizza: 1.5/5 The base of the pizza was horrible.

Cappuccino: 2/5 Not very appetizing at all.

Brownie with Ice cream: 3.5/5 The Brownie was not hot, but still the best of the lot.

Onion Rings:3/5 Okayish. Just Okayish

Veg Cutlet: 1/5 We felt as if stale ingredients were used to prepare the food.

1)Konjee crispy chicken
2)Pan fried fish
3)Hot and sour soup
4)manchow soup
5)Mixed meinfoon noodles
6) chicken in oyster sauce.
All the items were great in taste. Each said dish consisted of 8 pieces so quantity was enough. Special mention to Konjee crispy chicken which was a delight to the taste buds. Also the best part was the quality of the food wasn't degraded because of the festivities.
Also they have now started serving draught beer too. Cheers!",positive

But the thing that really bothered me is that it doesn't allow the customer to finish their food and instead is in a hurry to give us the bill....It really pissed me off... I understand its durga puja time and they need to accommodate people standing outside but still it should atleast someone to finish up their food..... I am not sure whether i will visit it again on puja but except puja i will definitely give the restaurant another try just because of the food....",negative

2519,"Hidden Gem in Kolkata for greasy Indo-Chinese. Stick to their pork dishes, PORK CHILLIE & PORK in HAMEI SAUCE are a must have. The YAM MEIN is another major highlight, they look like chowmein only but a bit thicker. Also try their steamed YAAM WONTONS. Portions are an absolute value for money. A hearty meal for two would cost 250-300 at max. Just ignore the ambience and enjoy the flavours. Carry cash, cards aren't accepted here.

Direction Tips
Location is a bit inconvenient considering the narrow lanes and bylanes (parking would be a tough job). Metro is the most convenient. Get down at Central and take exit no. 5 (Poddar Court). You would see Maharana Pratap statue as you step out. Cross the statue and take that right and keep walking for 5 mins. Meanwhile do stop by at POU CHONG on the way for their amazing collection of authentic Chinese sauces.

Bon Appetit :)",positive

We ordered 1 drums of heaven and half tandoori chicken as starters....one 650ml tuborg strong and one vodka base cocktail (sex on the beach)

Drums of heaven (Rs 220) : it comes in 6 lollipop size chicken... It's spicy juicy in taste. Crispy from outer and soft from inside....Soo tasty

Tandoori chicken half (Rs 200) : Two 2 Chicken breast pieces cooked in tandoor served with green chatni....

Sex on the beach (Rs 250) : nice mixture of 30ml vodka, canberry juice and orange juice... Value for money....

The one and only minus point of the place is there were no 330 ml beers which is really surprising.... Otherwise foods are nice and main course are also available.... Because of zomato gold one plus one food offer we got tandoori chicken free.... Bill was Rs 726 only....",negative

Traditional Footlong BLT: This one is a wholesome sandwich with generous servings of bacon, onion, tomato, lettuce, cucumber and mayonnaise dressing. It is served with French fries and ketchup. It's my favourite here and I almost always end up ordering the same thing.
Piggy Pizza: The thin crust has bacon, mozzarella and olives on top. It's crunchy and tasty.

The interior is well decorated with chairs on one side and comfortable floor seating on other.
Food: This is where the place really excels. We had gone for tandoori idli and cheese burst dosa. The tandoori idli was pretty amazing with totally deceptive looks. Had green chutney to the side which had the right amount of zing to it with perfect balance of lime and heat. The cheese burst dosa was also tasty which had gooey cheese oozing from the top. But the masala made the dosa crust soft.. The masala soda also hit the right balance. They also offered complimentary spiced butter milk.

Firstly, the ambience and service is good and prompt.
The Peri Peri french fries were just too good. The paw bhaji dosa was again something which you can't miss. The cheese garlic bread was good too.
The cold coffee had the perfect taste.

The pizza dosa is unmissable. It's a must try. The cheesy Maggi dosa was just ok. The chilly idli was a bit hard but taste wise it was good.

I would definitely recommend this place and am sure that the food will definitely bring you back.",positive
2589,"This is probably the most beautiful cafe that I visited recently.
Mrs. Wilson's Cafe is located at Ballygung beside Patha Bhawan school. It's basically a bungalow that is turned into a designer store cum cafe. The interiors have been kept very simple with colourful wall graffiti and the final touch has been given with some beautiful lights.
Again, the most important part is that the furniture and everything else in the cafe has been recycled.
According to me the most beautiful corner of this cafe is the outer seating area at the balcony. It's perfect for winter days. The calm atmosphere and beautiful neighbourhood adds to it.

2654,This is a multi cuisine restaurant at the downstairs of a hotel cum serviced apartments which ticks all the right boxes. The general trend is all the dishes were inherently juicy and succulent albeit can't be considered always authentic. The tandoori chicken for example had this trait.

The sauce wasn't exactly the Momo sauce, so that too needs some attention because momo sauce needs to be spicier. But however the BB Special Momo which I ordered was great. I ordered it in the Panfried sauce. It was a mixed meat momo consisting of Prawn & Pork. Was delicious!

2773,"A cafe tucked in the lanes of New Market. Ideal for satisfying your hunger pangs while a shopping haul at Esplanade.
Ordered:

ü§ò Mango Juice- Tastes pretty good, thick and claggy.

ü§ò Chicken and Mayo Sandwich - The presentation could have been better. However, the sandwich is stuffed with ample pieces of chicken. Taste could have been better.

ü§ò Butter chicken and Tandoori Roti- The taste of the butter chicken is authentic. The quantity could have been a little more in accordance with the price. Perfect mix of spices though.

Pocket friendly. Ample accommodation. Service is good.",negative

I and my friend was walking by the vivekanand road and saw this small outlet named ""Hungerpangs"" . So decided to have something from here.

We ordered 1 Cold Coffee, 1 Mojito with lemon n mint.

And they do charge service tax 2.5% .

Tastes were good. Specially the cold coffee was well made and served with 1 scoop of ice cream.

Will soon try other food items.

Food: However the food is really good. We had a sandwich and a chocolate creme. The sandwich was well made and the chocolate creme absolutely stole our heart.

The second thing we ordered was a vegetable grilled sandwich, which we ended up cancelling because it had a very weird taste and smelled like raw uncooked unwashed vegetables.¬†

2. 1 combo ( 1 leg, 4 wings , small popcorn) (4/5)-

We also ordered a Gnocchi and a plate of Pita Pizza. The Gnochhi was soft and succulent, and it was wok tossed with butter and chilly. There was a hint of lemon grass and the fresh coriander leaves made it  taste amazing. 

The simplicity of the Pita Pizza was what made it a memorable dish. Simple yet elegant. The tomato sauce was homemade. The pizza was topped with ample amount of cheese. 

Do visit this place to taste a different side of vegetarian dishes.

Though the boiled egg is missing from their biriyani yet for me its a hit because of the flavour!
Chicken tandoori was a bit dry but tasted nice.
Drums of heaven was nice.
Not tried other chinese items yet..will surely order in the near future!",positive

Price is reasonable.

Ambience and music is good inside.


The cons:
The smoking zone may become a bit congested.

Staff behaviour may become better.",positive
3238,"This is an exceptionally delicious way to start your day.
The decor is colourful ,the interiors are bright .
We started off with Assam tea which was served with complimentary ginger-chocolate cookies.
The lemon marble cake we had with the tea was hot,fluffy and soft.
We tried their Ham and cheese omlette with bacon added-on.The eggs were perfectly cooked and the cheese mixed with the egg to give a delicious creamy flavour and texture to the omlette.The chunks of ham were the necessary crunchy bites complimenting the omlette.The bacon was beautifully well done yet soft. Neither chewy nor over crispy.They served it with toasts.
We also had their Schnitzel which was a breaded chicken cutlet served with mayonnaise and salad.
The quality of chicken was tender.
Very satisfying breakfast with foods of the highest quality filling you up and making you ready for the day.",positive

Coming to the food, I have tried sushi from a multitude of eateries in Kolkata and none of them could make me actually like the dish however this was a completely different experience. I really liked what they served and the sushi was definitely a winner. The Sticky rice and noodles were lovely as well.

Ordered a butter garlic paneer dosa and sambar vada for lunch today. The paneer stuffing had such a foul smell, that the dosa had to be discarded. Sambar consistency resembled water and it neither had any veggies, not any taste. Again had to be discarded. Only saving grace being the vadas which seemed to be freshly prepared.

Also they charged ‚Çπ20 packaging charge for sending all the condiments in plastic pouches and dosa being wrapped in a aluminium foild and newspaper.

Never ordering again.",negative

They provide real Bhetky fish at a much lower price of Rs200/- only which was very shocking for me.. The quality and quantity of all the dishes are really fulfilling.. One of the best Chinese restaurant I have ever gone and that so at a pocket friendly price..
PS:- Would like to visit their again and again.. I just love all the fish main courses as they provide original Bhetky..Also their mixed hakka noodles and hot garlic chicken are delicious!!",positive

It's not a high-profile restaurant but fair enough for occasional visits. The preparations are not exceptional and the price is a bit higher considering the quality.

However, it's still a place that attracts foodies ( mostly from IT sectors around New Town) for the simplicity it offers and variety it delivers.",negative
3536,"Not at all good. I think they put a huge amount of dalda in their Biriyani. Mutton Biriyani has a piece of Mutton which is full of fat and bone, very chewy, not at all soft to tear, one has to fight to tear the flesh out. Chicken Biriyani has hard and overcooked tasteless chicken. Chanp are again too oily which is actually overdose of dalda. As the gravy cools down the oil start to thicken just as dalda or low quality fat do. Over spicy with a huge amount of cloves which actually gives you a burning sensation at your throat. I would strongly recommend my friend to avoid this Biriyani joint.",negative
3540,"They always greet you with prawn chips and never compromise on quality. My friends and I very often frequent this place. We mostly order rice and noodles. Must try their mixed burnt garlic rice with chicken in oyster sauce. Devil chicken is my personal favorite. They are all less spicy yet pleasingly tasty. .
And if you like pork, you will love this place.",positive
3549,Chicken butter masala with pulao along with gulab jamuns. This is what I ordered from the long menu of The Rice Guys . They have really got a variety of options. And I personally loved it. A very good option to choose. The butter masala was tasty. It had enough gravy to have the whole rice with. Taste wise it was great. Quantity wise I think it is sufficient for a person having low appetite. The gulab jamuns were really soft and yummy. I am surely gonna try more from this place.,negative

A cup of English Breakfast will cost you around ‚Çπ63(including GST)!! An Earl Grey will come for the same.
They also have varieties of foods...
Food tastes quite good
Food quality is also good
Food quantity is on the lower side
Food after effects are bit acidic(but that's what you expect after you eat a plate of fish & chips!)
Teas here are just awesome!!
One bad thing about them is the locality, you need to know the area a little to find it!

3652,"The most delightful and wonderful gastronomic experience I had when I ordered burgers from here. There burgers are different from the regular ones we have, not like the usual ones we have. I ordered The Magic Shroom and Chicka Lika and both of them were outstandingly good.

The Magic Shroom: Mushroom mashed and combined with cheese, pure heavenly taste. The patty was huge enough and the cheddar cheese was added goodness.

Chica Licka: Another one which won my heart, grilled chicken patty, fried eggs, chicken sausage and chicken salami; the fillings are enough to make you understand how good it can be. The in house cheese blend was also palatable. Highly recommended.

I am definitely going to order again from here to try their different burgers.

We visited this place during durga puja, the restaurant doesn't serve buffet during the pujas. So we had to order from the menu.
What we ordered: Mixed fried rice and chicken in stir fried black pepper sauce.
The fried rice tasted delicious. It had prawns, fish, chicken and eggs. The prawn was very soft and almost melted in my mouth. The fish pieces were also good. The fried rice was not oily. It had a lovely aroma and minimum spice. The quantity is not sufficient for two people.
Coming up next, the stir fried chicken in black pepper sauce. This dish had 10 pieces of chicken. Diced and deep fried. Lovely gravy. The black pepper flavour was not very strong yet made it's presence felt. It matched perfectly with the fried rice.
The decor is very soothing. Calm ambience. The staff were also very polite and friendly.

All these came at INR 129, though I felt the quantity justified the reasonably low price. The noodles was pretty average but nice. The fried momos were oily and not too big but quite generously stuffed with minced carrots, paneer, etc. The garlic panner was tasty and the two paneer pieces were soft and pretty fresh. Trying the Kimchi was the worst decision as it was filled with smelly local cabbage and I almost felt like puking. Besides the kimchi, rest were edible and nice, if not great.

The Service was fast because the Sabjis are Already Prepared before hand in a Large scale and as I Told it's great for takeaways. The Food is Cleanly Packed plus the Taste is Sober. I personally feel the Veg Pulao could have been better with taste.
I'm Rating it 4star because there are a few things which can be Taken care of like Sitting arrangements though space is less, the food if are Prepared beforehand must be Heated So that when the food reaches home it remains hot.

Let's come to the point. Firstly, I would like to see more professional attitude from the table attendants while visiting next time. They were attentive and polite, but may be little inexperienced. The tissue holder was empty and after waiting for long time I had to ask for it. Such small things matter to make an impression. Moreover, going for the first time I expected voluntary menu suggestions from them. But I must say they served our orders quickly.

The only reason I have rated '4' is because of the food quality and presentation. From the Earl Grey Tea, Americano to the Pizza I liked the everything.

Guntur Karam Dosa @ Chennai Xpress II, Sec I - Salt Lake ‚ò∫

Served along with the customary Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and Onion-Tomato Chutney, it was a lavish Dosa filled with a unique concoction of dried coconut chutney and assorted veggies and cooked in dollops of butter (read generous).

Though the stuffing was sans any potato, still it was filling and tasty. It never tasted like that of a Jini Dosa.

The Dosa tasted excellent. You need to eat it to believe it.

The Chutneys were good, but the Sambhar needed a lot of improvement.

One person may find it difficult to finish an entire Dosa.

Ordered tandoori aloo paratha. It was avg. Expected better
ordered some tandoori chicken. It was very good. Restaurant quality. Very pleased .and they have offers going on.it was kinda cheap too.
also tried their biriyani on the 79 offer. Felt the quantity might be little less.no egg also the chicken pc didn't have much meat. üôÑ Well its for 79 that's why i won't judge much but still

Ordered mutton roll,it was very good. Will try the biriyani next.the prices they have after 30% off is perfect.they are a new place.initialy i thought the Prices were very high for new place in a locality like ours.they should keep it like that until they have a foothold on the market",negative

Location: Ruby crossing. The Gateway hotel, ground floor

Ambiance: Nice serene and one of the best place to sit with your friends and family.

Food & Drinks: Honestly not a great spread compared to the other buffets in town, on the started they had dahi phuchkas, papri chat. The salad spread was quite good. On the main course the spread as average, some really good looking dishes but from the taste perspective nothing great. I was a bit disappointed on the deserts and sweets section, in terms of the presentation they were great but not that great while you had it.",positive

4313,"It's always the small places that get lost in the big names in the cutthroat market that is the Sec 5 food biz. But we are glad we found this place serving quality food at verrry budget friendly prices. Be prepared to share your table though, because demand and supply (of seats) don't match, especially during lunch hour.
Anyway, we were lucky to get a seat at lunch hour and wasted no time in getting to order. Service was prompt and staff friendly. Food took a tad longer to arrive but we were not complaining once we tasted. Ordered mixed fried rice and chili oyster fish. The rice was loaded with chicken, eggs and prawns which were fresh as they come. Quantities are more than enough for two people. The fish was perfectly cooked, with generous sized pieces in a savoury gravy.

Did not get a chance to click pictures, but will update on later visits to explore the menu of this great little find. Cheerios!",positive

1. Jeera Rice and Butter Chicken Combo- The Jeera Rice was good. The gravy of butter chicken, although creamy, was very very salty. However, the two tasted good together. It came with a salad (that is thin sliced onion and carrot)

2. Gajar Ka Halwa with Rabri- It has to be the worst Gajar Ka Halwa I've ever had üòì. Firstly, there was no rabri at all. It was just like having shredded carrot with milk. The carrot was completely raw and it was made with plain milk, not rabri. Moreover, it was stale. It tasted sour and had a weird smell.

Packaging was good though.

My bill was INR 200 (after discount)

The waiters were well behaved and kind enough to make us taste their new launch which is about to be in this Durga Puja (2018), basil rice ( Non veg).

I must say that the burgers they serve are way better than the KFC burgers. Chicken Soupy Noodles is a must try if you love authentic Chinese Cuisine and Pan fried Chicken Pops which was suggested by them tasted heavenly. The basil rice was topped with some chicken pops and it also tasted good.

For mains we went for their 5 Treasure Veg Rice, as the name suggests it includes 5 vegetables beautifully coocked in fried rice and tasted fine. For side dish a fish . Which is not too tasty.

Price are moderate, quantity and quality served is fine, though service needs improvement. Staff are good and attentive also.There was a prolonged wait for water glasses being refilled.

I chanced upon this outlet by sheer luck and had the best meal in weeks, all for 200 rupees flat.

The CHEESE VADA PAV(4.5/5)is delicious although there's mayonnaise instead of cheese. But who cares when the final result tastes impeccable anyway?

The CHEESE GARLIC BREAD(5/5) is so darn delicious (quoting Mr. Ramsay). It's better than most pizzas I've had this year with the exact same taste of a well-made margherita.

The MIXED SAUCE SPAGHETTI (3/5) is way too 'saucy' but tastes fine.

Zomato did a great job with the delivery.

The prices are dirt cheap.

We tried the Corn and Spinach Spring Rolls, which were perfect in taste. The outer layer of the spring rolls were very crispy. The Baby corn was superb too. Not soggy as it is usually found in many restaurants. The best dish was the Paneer Tikka which came out on a sizzling plate. The taste was really nice.¬†
For the main course I had the Burnt Garlic Fried Rice. With the right amount of garlic, the combination was amazing. The portion sizes are good enough if there are a couple of people on the table. They have a full bar available too.¬†

Anyway, the chef recommended the tenderloin steak which tasted really amazing. The meat was tender and juicy. The dip was perfect. But the garlic bread was way too soft and didn't compliment the meal at all.
However really excited to execute the menu further.
Will return soon. üëç",negative

We tried a variety of shakes like kit kat shake,chocolate freak shake and also a unique pani puri shake which was surprisingly tasty,among eatables we had blueberry muffins,chocolate pastry among desserts and among other dishes we tried out mix sauce pasta,chicken nuggets and mini pizza.
The food quality was pretty good and most of the dishes were delicious.

The burger contained juicy crispy double chicken fillets with a cheese slice on top & lettuce. The burger was full of chicken & you can feel it. In Chicken hot wings , the wings were mixed with different kind of spices then deep fried & served with hot garlic sauce. It was too spicy.

The place serves good food but better option to take away or to order online. The sitting place is not good. So order & enjoy it in your comfortable palce.

I would not say pocket friendly because the quantity & kind of food they are serving price goes to higher side. You can try once and then decide according to me.",negative

The murg makhmali tikka as a starter was delicious, but there was no pudina chutney to accompany it.:(

Chicken hakka noodles and prawn manchurian were lip smacking (the prawns were jumbo sized).

We ordered tandoori roti and plain naan to accompany Kashmiri alu dum and Delhi wala chicken bharta which was very good.

The staff was friendly, particularly the manager who attended to us and even advised on menu choices, in spite of the Christmas rush.",positive

We wanted sweet corn they served us lemon coriander which was tasteless. We ordered jhaal farezi paneer and dal makhani with masala kulcha. It's safe to say jhaal farezi paneer did not look like one . The order took literally forever to come. We waited I guess for an hour atleast. The washroom were so dirty and disgusting. The restaurant wasn't clean. Least to say extremely disappointed with the visit.,negative
5070,Very nice concept...i mean i love the idea of selling just Khichdi to people. Because somedays are meant to for Khichdi. I had ordered Bhoger er Khichuri and the Khichdi Combo. As per the taste it was nice but there is a chance of improvement and it can be made tastier. All the best.,positive

We went there back in September, the day they turned 3. Was craving for Chinese so thought of trying out this place.

What we had -

‚Ä¢Chicken Manchow Soup
‚Ä¢Chili Prawn Dry
‚Ä¢Mixed Manchurian Gravy Noodles

The soup was good but a bit tangy. The chili prawn is highly recommended. It had the perfect blend of spices and sauces. The noodles was also tasty.

Since it was their birthday, we got a discount on our total bill and it came down to ‚Çπ344.

Will visit again soon, try out their other variants and update the review soon. Till then, Happy Gorging!

They also have an option for Shisha, but they don't have a menu for the same so remember to ask the price before hand in case to avoid a confusion later.

In terms of cost, it is not much on a higher side. They also have there own offers going on. You can opt for them in case you donot have a gold membership.

If all things done right, it has the potential to become one of the happening places in the city.

Gravy chowmein was very tasty. Best of them was lemon chucken. It was tangy, juicy and chicken was tender",positive

5781,"I think this place is a bit underrated, their pocket friendly items if not outstanding, then certainly they are above average.

I enjoyed very much the three crispy,crunchy and succulent pieces of fried chicken which I had ordered online from this place.Though the restaurant took longer than usual to confirm my order, it was delivered swift by the very professional Zomato valet.

The three chicken pieces were very nicely coated with batter and deep fried in oil. These desi versions of KFC will certainly give the giant a run for its money if they diversify their menu and become more professionally oriented.

The euphoria over having good food at pocket friendly price was somewhat marred by the pathetic quality of their packaging. I think what is used for packaging roadside telebhaja should not used for delivering online orders by established shops.",positive
5789,"A November evening spent well at Chennai Express- a place where I have tried yummiest of Dosa at Kolkata. Both quality of food and cleanliness were of superb quality! I truly enjoyed my Dosa moments savouring the crispy, cheesy Dosa. What amazed me was that the Dosa was crispy from the time it was served till I finished gobbling it;)
I would definitely recommend this place to all Dosa lovers!

I through it will contain four pieces of pav and the potato curry will have a great flavour, but it wasn't the case. When I received the packet there was two pieces of pav and the potato curry tasted awfully bad. They added a lot of lemon in it. It might be that the potato curry had become bad, thus they added a lot of lemon to make unaware about the fact. This was really not expected. Experience was really bad.",negative

Yesss the crowd was so horrible which i would expect from a B grade place.. I don't know whether they allowed such type of crowd only for that day or that is just a natural phenomenon for them which i could definitely be sure about in my next visit, which i will go only to confirm the above facts.. Now coming to the place it was just awesome with loud music, awesome dj and nice hookah and not so expensive menu...

The idlys were soft and prepeared well..

Not expected.",negative
6107,"Although the service of the staff is wonderful, the food is quite disastrous at Cal 27's buffet. In fact, the f&b in their buffet spread is what disappointment tastes like, quite literally. The cheeses kept out were stale. The desserts were definitely not fresh in taste, either. The pizza barely had any pizza sauce on it. The pastas were bland. The aloo tikkis lacked any flavor and were greasy. My mom, who tried the chicken katthi rolls was taken aback, too. The pineapple juice was watered down. Even the cappuccino I finished off with was nasty. Their lobby coffee shop has much better tasting coffee + desserts in comparison. And, given the price point of Cal 27's buffet, I have to say JW Marriott's spread is way better and cheaper.",negative
6110,"In their strive to be a bit different, they are right on the mark. Well mostly. The most important aspect of serving tasty dishes - they were never far off from. Special mention goes out to the Chicken Caffreal, a Portuguese delicacy that brought back my childhood memories of typicial Bengali dish of dhoney chicken (Chicken is green coriander sauce). The thin crust Californian pizza is a great dish to order. If you are in for spicy food(well technically drink in this case) go for the unique mocktail 'Some like it hot'. The chocolate truffle in dessert would certainly satisfy your sweet cravings. A highly recommended place to visit!!",positive

Indian Chicken: Chicken pieces were good at this time but gravy was not at all tasty.
Dal fry: Good in taste
Matar Paneer: Okay not very good.

I tried :

‚Ä¢ Soya Bean Tikka - This is an unique dish where soya chunks are grilled over tandoor. This isn't available anywhere else in Kolkata. The soya bean was very soft and juicy.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Tikka Roll - The soft roomali rotis were stuffed with paneer cubes and veggies. It tasted delicious. I loved the sauce they had used.

‚Ä¢ Special Thali - The special Thali is grand. It includes naan, Pulao, paneer, soya bean, dal Makhani and gulab jamun. The meal was amazing. Each dish tasted good.

‚Ä¢ Veg Tandoori Momos - These were the best veg momos I've ever had. It had such a wonderful flavour. I completely fell in love with it.

Overall, I'm in love with the food here. Be a vegetarian or a non vegetarian, one must try out the food here.

The only con of this place is the continuous flashing of car headlights on our faces, as this causes a lot of disturbances. The overall experience here was pleasant.

Fish Fry: Well in Kolkata no restaurant can really make a bad fish fry I guess. But theirs is definitely one of the best.

Fish Butter Fry: This one is my absolute favourite. It definitely is very oily. But equally tasty too. The fish inside is cooked beautiful and the batter provides a good crunch.

Fish Finger: The stuffing is good. And hence is the fry.

Aloo bhaja: I have a strong weakness towards jhujhure aloo bhaja. It always reminds me of Maa. And they always make me happy by having it.

To all my fish lover friends, hop in this place for a cheap tasty fishy experience!!",positive

Though Chicken Biriyani is a no go but chicken roll is one of their best. Noodles and Momos are available too but noodles didn't impress me much either. Cleanliness is something that can be worked upon. If you are really hungry or looking for food in real hurry it is not a bad place to hop in.,negative
6470,"After a tiresome pandal hopping on astami and searching several Zomato options near us we decided to give it a try.It was hardly 5to 8mints walking distance from kalighat metro.A puja special menu of limited dishes was served.We ordered fish tikka and murg banjara for starter and chicken biryani, chicken kadai for main course.I preferred fish tikka the most.Its pieces were very tender and juicy with a crispy coating.5/5.The other starter item was delicious too 5/5 .I wish the quantity of chicken was a little better in the biriyani but overall It tasted good 4/5.chicken kadai was fine 3/5.ambience:well decorated with a sophisticated background and beautiful fountain in the entrance give this place a picture perfect look.5/5. Staff: courteous and helpful.5/5. Overall I really enjoyed this place and hope to visit it soon.",positive

The food tasted pretty good with good presentation. The staff was polite and well behaved.",positive

6485,"Oh, such a quaint little cosy place. The staff is impeccably warm. Their selection of tea is excellent although I wouldn't recommend their coffee.

6504,"Located on the busy BT. Road, near the four point crossing at chiriamore. A very old hotel to be precise. One of the hotel in this area that serves till 12am. A road side dhaba type of a hotel with tables and chairs and non ac. Always busy serving innumerable customers daily. Thus one must not worry of old stinky food.
Thay have a good variety of food that travellers prefers. Food tastes good and quantity is also satisfying. They serves too tasty tea as well.
A dhaba come hotel where one can bring in his family for luncheon or to dine.",positive

And ordered Chrispy Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Fish Manchurian, Blue Lagoon and Mango Punch. The chicken was very tasty. The rice tasted normal and the fish was tasty too. Coming to the drinks, Blue Lagoon was a bit salty and the mango punch was tasty.

This place serves good food at a very affordable price. Food is very tasty their and the service is prompt too!",positive
6538,"Be you, a three storied cafe with really nice and lively interior. The second floor had the best seating and this cafe really huge.
Food was okiesh....
We ordered a chilli chicken, chicken 65 and chili garlic noodles.
The chinese appetiser was drooling but chicken 65 was average, it was hard and had a lot of curry leaves as garnish.
The service was good. They charged extra service tax of 10% after including gst.
Sheesha was good, but we were not allowed to choose the flavours for the complimentary hookah which they served due to some offers running in their cafe.
Staff was good.
Over all a rating of 4stars.",positive
6539,A good place for sheesha and food. The ambience is amazing. The wall posters and decor is good to take photos too. The service is a little slow but the food is worth it.,positive

6569,"Allured by the good reviews & offer, I ordered Mutton Biryani half plate at just Rs. 98. But to my utter disappointment the rice of the Biryani was tasteless and didn't taste anything like the Kolkata Biryani. The mutton piece was soft yet was full of fat. Very bad experience. Even the roadside stalls offer better Biryani. I hope they improve their quality to stay in the game.",negative
6572,"Ambience too noisy like most of the bar-cum-restaurants. But it doesn't matter if the food is right. But in this case, food was bad also. The quality is okay. But the quantity is so less. Keeping the pricetags in mind, the quantity is very very less. Hence it can easily be classified as 'highly overpriced'. We ordered three main courses. And it just about filled the two of us. I repeat, three main courses for two persons. The quantity is that less. Glad we had Zomato Gold. So, unless you have a good offer with you, avoid this place. Highly not recommended.",negative
6584,The place is just awesome!!! The vibe at this place is just overwhelming and extravagant. The new party destination in the city !!!!! Also the food and cocktails are super awesome!!,positive

6606,A fast food shop to the core. They have takeaways as well as seating arrangements. Was one of my favourite during college days. I have always loved their biriyani which comes cheap yet tasty. . They have maintained their taste and kept reasonable pricing too. Famous for chicken biriyani. Though they sell other cuisine but definitely go for their biriyani,positive
6609,So this place is located at the Haltu Bazar more and this is the only food joint in the area. There is no seating available and the place looks pretty unhygienic. The food is cheap though and the Chinese cuisine doesn't taste too bad. But completely avoid the biriyani. The combo offer is good enough and with no other restaurants nearby this place is a life-saver.,negative

Food: Now coming to the food. Dont judge a book by its cover. This place serves amazing food at a pretty affordable price. We so love this place. Their biriyani is very simple and delicious. Tandoori nuns are very soft. Kababs are yummy and filling. Mughlai dishes are up to mark. Not only this. They are also specialist in Chinese cuisine. Mixed fried rice, noodles, chilly chicken, sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken are absolutely amazing. Highly recommended. Please do visit. You will fall in love with this place.

Starters for nonveg, Chicken Pakoda which is really cooked so well, tender, you can enjoy with hot Veg Sweet Corn Soup which is available in 3different quantity. When it comes to main course Steamed Chilly Garlic Chicken Noodles along with Chilly Garlic Chicken can be one of the best combo.

6713,"This place is located in Santoshpur and is housed in the first floor. I went there with my sister. The d√©cor was really classy. We ordered a starter which was Roasted Pork in Soya Chilli Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken and a rice dish named Khao Pad Kra Prao.

Coming to the food:
The Roasted Pork was perfectly cooked with the right fat to meat ratio. But the amount was too little and the taste was a bit on the sweet side and I mostly prefer my pork to be spicy.

The quantity of rice was really good. It was enough for the two of us. And the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good too.

Verdict: Price is reasonable. But the quantity of the Pork Starter was not value for money at all.",negative
6715,"Another restaurant dishing out some very good Asian (Oriental) food. They have a lot of variety in their menu. They were spot on with the food, and some items did stand out e.g. Chilli Chicken, Hunan Basa Fish, Butter Garlic Chicken. The Mei foon was of supreme quality too. We were highly impressed with the food and looking forward to visiting this place in order to experience the hospitality and ambience. The only point, that needs correction is that on a home delivery, they should be labelling the items. Otherwise, all okay.",positive
6724,"An average delivery.
Not very satisfied.
The combo contained noodles, 2 pc of fried momos which was nothing but the momo used as the Manchurian. Came along a very spicy and sour achar. The packaging was great but overall, not pleased at all.",negative
6733,Every weekend I can be seen in this place. The ambience is great though a small place. You can sit outside also if you want to. Coming to the food! I have tasted almost every sandwich there. They are great. Mini kives is a wonderful dish one must taste. They make great coffee there. Try irish coffee (black). Pocket pinch on the cheaper side.,positive
6734,Liked the ambience of the place though it's quite small. Ordered crystal chicken which was succulent and a chicken sandwich. Also had a fried chicken variety which was good. The cheese chicken omelet was delicious. Cold coffee was also of top quality. The only issue is delivery speed is quite slow and waiters need to be more eager and courteous in serving customers.,positive
6741,"In search of some kababs we decided to try out Aafreen in wellesley. From the outside the restaurant seemed pretty spacious and well planned. We went inside and ordered for some Chicken Reshmi kababs. We were running out of time so decided to parcel it instead. 
The price came around ‚Çπ220 ( inclusive of GST ) and within 10 mins it was served to us. 

Although by the time we reached home the Kababs were cold but they tasted delicious. I didn‚Äôt have good Reshmi kababs in Kolkata for quite some time so it was a complete bliss for me. Will sure recommend this place to others & I myself will surely go back to try out the other stuffs and dine in the restaurant itself. 

P.S‚Äî This review is completely based on their prompt service & the taste of the Reshmi Kababs as that‚Äôs the only item we tried.",positive

The crowd is mostly aged people sipping on their tea and flipping through news paper or cooking up a storm over some political issue.¬† A good place to hangout with friends if up for chat at no fancy place and low on budget. They serve milk, black and lemon tea and snacks with it, tea cake, munchies and toasts.¬†
One exceptional item is paan cake, shaped like a betel nut leaf or heart and very fluffy and filled with tutti fruit.

1) Chicken corn club sandwich(4/5): Since club sandwich, it had 3 bread slices, cut into two triangles. The filling of the sandwich was wholesome. It was full of corn and chicken and it was all cheesy. I absolutely loved it. One triangle itself is enough filling. Also , with the sandwiches they gave a lays chips packet, which I found pretty cute.
2) Corn paneer sandwich(4/5): This was also awesome like the other. Had a lot of corn and paneer and was all cheesy.
Their delivery was also very fast, the sandwiches were hot when they arrived , the sandwiches were very good, also they were very affordable. All in all, a very good experience. Will definitely be ordering from here in the future.",positive

During puja they are running on skeleton crew which is creating the delay and casual staffs have low or no knowledge of how many pieces are served in a single plate, which created confusion.

These days they do not provide fresh chicken/mutton at all. We ordered Biryani twice from Shyama in the last month. The aroma was good but the taste was not up to the mark. The piece of Chicken felt like rubber. It was too oily. Thus I won't recommend you to give it a try unless they start focusing on their quality.",negative

1) Super late delivery. They took close to 3 hours to deliver.

Orders :
1) Chicken Biryani-Had a generous quantity of rice, one large piece of chicken, a soft boiled potato and a boiled egg. Tasted decent.
2) Chilli chicken-Regular taste nothing noteworthy

‚ñ™Creamy garlic chicken sandwich: Firstly the amount provided was enough for a snack for two.. The creamy garlic created an essence which is really close to my heart. The amalgamation of such is amazing.

‚ñ™Chicken wings in sechwan sauce: If you like some spicy endeavour for your taste bud, this particular dish is a must try. The four pieces of wings served in hot sechwan sauce will definitely make you want more.

Pocket pinch is moderate.",negative

7312,it is a new restaurant and the staff was very courteous and the place look very clean and fresh the food quality was also good and it is a decent place for us to visit with our family but my only point of a little dissatisfaction was its price range according to me it should be priced a little cheaper but I very well understand the restaurants perspective because it's a new restaurant and it is providing Quality Services so its cost is a bit higher so the prices are high too but all in all I really enjoyed this place so I would like to give this place 3. 5 stars thank you,negative

It's just 5 mins away from my home and I m in Love with this taste of Kolkata Biriyani with Aloo since Society Started serving may be 15 years back. Quality is never compromised at this place at a very very affordable Price. Only downside, it's only take away and other side dishes apart from Biriyani are not that good. But I still believe Society serves one of the best biriyani in this town.",positive
7369,Firstly this place is really cheap to have a drink which is a great plus point. Other than that I really like the way this place is decorated. Food quality is also ok.

7383,"Recently ordered food from this restaurant. Can't deny the fact the prices are quite reasonable. However, they really need to work on the food quality.

I ordered few butter naans, chicken bharta and egg tarka. Even if I consider the food quality as average (considering the reasonable price), there's no excuse for the bad quality naan. They were really hard to even break with your mouth. my gums started paining next morning as I had to chew those hard stuffs. You can't have naans that hard. Otherwise, they can improve the overall food quality a bit.

My rating is 2 out of 5. I deduct points mainly for the bad quality naans.",negative

Their speciality is Moglai Paratha, it's the traditional Moglai Paratha with only egg, chopped onion and green chillies as stuffing, it's served with Jacketed (with skin) potato curry. When many shops are using Sattu and Various kind of non veg as stuffing they are using only beaten egg chopped onion and green chillies which really take one to the bygone era where the Moglai serving shops used this as stuffing.

2) Potato burger (4/5): The potato patty was thick enough to fill one's stomach combined with mayonnaise, onions(chopped) and capsicums (chopped) and some oregano was sprinkled on the top of the burger.
I liked the taste of this item.

Quality/Taste = Very ordinary
Quantity (Size of the Portions Served) = Hilarious
Prices = Abysmal

Prices are absolutely disproportionate with the quality and quantity. Do not get deceived by the pictures of products they have uploaded. It‚Äôs expected the photographs will make the food look a little better but this place has taken the concept of exaggeration to a whole different level.
Let‚Äôs take the Fish Fry for example, tastes ordinary at best and if you look at its size you would secretly wish that you had instead poked literal holes on your currency notes. All said and done, the one thing I really liked was the Kashundi (Mustard Sauce), its one of the best I have had by far. You will leave the place as hungry as you walked in.",negative

Inside lots of seating; some near the central kitchen, some streetside, some beside the bar, take your pick. Service is relaxed but courteous. If you are wondering if anyone is working on your order, dont, they are, just at a slower pace while managing hotel and phone orders. Maybe ask for a coffee while you wait.

It has 2 sitting areas. One with chairs and the other with cushions to sit on the ground.
They have various board games to pass your time with your friends as you gulp in your food. They also have some books to read your way sipping a cup of hot chocolate.
Coming to the we had ordered Cream of Chicken soup and a non veg bowl.
The soup was really tasty.
Coming to the non veg bowl I felt the quantity was more than enough for two people but the only disappointed was that the vegetables were not the appropriate size and not well cooked.
Had some beverage also which I have forgotten now but it was good too.
So all in all, would revisit this place again to hang out with my friends maybe.",negative

Kochu bata was so good, I never had that awesome Kochu bata in my life. Daal, bhaja was also too tasty. Dahi rui was so delicious. But topse fry was not fresh, batter was too thick.

Had the :

Cheese Mushroom Momo ( steamed ) - Quite lip-smacking in taste. There was cheese but unfortunately, i didn't find a single piece of mushroom. They serve 8 pieces for a single plate.

Chicken Momo ( steamed ) - They were like so - so in taste. The chicken filling inside could be more tastier and also I felt that the skin of the dumpling is also a bit thick.

Keep your quality and service intact.
Today I ordered 3 combos ( non veg Chinese meal) via zomato.
In the meal, you will get generous quantity of chicken fried rice, 4 pcs of boneless chicken in chilly or Manchurian gravy and 1 pc of gulab jamun. It's a steal deal indeed at RS 89 just.
However, got 3 combos at just RS 167 by applying promo code.
Now coming to the food and packaging.
Packaging is top notch with no spillage of food and served piping hot.
Quantity and quality are both equally good.
However, I deducted 1 rating for lack of salt and pepper in fried rice which tasted blant just of those 2 things.
Chicken Manchurian gravy was tasty and pcs of chicken were big and fresh.

8440,"Sometimes in life, we need to slow down and reflect upon the fact that what we have achieved and what's left for us to conquer in life.
What better place to do that than by the riverside at Raichak on Ganges, sitting underneath the glowing sun and actually having a scrumptious meal?
Perhaps the most versatile menu there is, it ranges through Fish Amritsari, Corn Palak, Chhanar Daalna, Misti Polao, Patuir, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Biryani and a few more dishes.

Personally, this menu gives the feels of the Pujo Vibe. But then again, it should as it is designed specifically for them. Those who like to slow down when the world is moving at an insane pace.

Must haves:
Biryani
Pulao
Kochi Pathar Jhol
Good Music to accompany.

The fish were well marinated and coated, soft and delicious.
I didn't like the mustard sauce very much though. It had a very strong smell of mustard, almost like raw kasundi. I have had fish in mustard sauce in other restaurants and the taste was very subtle.
Other dishes I have ordered include: Non Veg Combo. Affordable and sufficient for a single person.
The have 4 options to choose from for the side dish: hunan chicken, oyster chicken, schezwan chicken and chilli chicken.

The Aloo cheese parantha was good. The stuffing was good filled with cheese and aloo. However, the sabji served alongwith the parantha didnt taste that good and has a room for improvement in there. Also the raita didnt taste good. The curd added to it had become sour and it totally ruined the experience of the raita.",negative

The taste was okish..As there were onions,tomatoes,corns and all..They served 2 pieces triangular breads for one plate sandwich..

The main issue was that there was no difference between veg cheese sandwich and veg sandwich..Both were same..Even the cheese was less in quantity..If they charged for extra cheese then there should be extra layers of cheese..Nextly the breads were grilled but not properly..Otherwise i will give them a good rating..

They should overcome this problems..",negative

But we soon learnt that all the chicken dishes used basically the same chicken, just in a different curry. The Do Pyaza was a bit sweet, but the Dhania Chicken didn‚Äôt have any taste per se. The Roti was a welcome relief as they were soft Nd made out of atta, just as i like them.

Only cons we have found are, they can serve some more mayonnaise and more lettuce with burgers..

Today went with my mother and had dahi phuchka & dahi papri chaat. Both were exactly precisely made perfect. You have to try this whenever you are in new market. The total bill came to Rs 140.,positive
10189,"Located under the Shriram Arcade complex, If there's any place where I've had more Chole Bature than any other, it has to be this joint. Esplanade is the place to hang out in true sense growing up around the area and I must have visited this restaurant more than 100 times if not less. Although being a south Indian joint, they do serve authentic preparations when it comes to Chole Bature and that's what most order when they're here. Time doesn't seem to effect an oldie like this and the memories with school time buddies at this hub still remains.

Being an all veg place, TFHR restaurant indeed offers great southern preparations and that to at a very affordable price.",positive
10205,Ordered paneer butter masala and aloo methi from this place. Both the vegetables were okay. I found it a little oily . But I order from this place when my mom is away. The taste is like ghar ka khana. The aunty is very polite. And the service is good.,negative

10276,"This was a classic when there were less chinese restaurants in the city. Over time their quality degraded. They used to specialize over crab dishes. Now they are not available. Recently visited this place during the pujas..i must say they loat their charm. We had ordered mein foon(rice noodles) ,fried rice and kafulok fish and kung pao chicken for mains. The side dishes did not have enough gravy. The fried rice was very ordinary. Mein foon was okay. We had also ordered ginger fried chicken and prawn fries and chicken corn soup for starters. Nothing was too fancy to be mention worthy. Very ordinary chinese food which can now be found in the simplest of restaurants in Kolkata. The staffs were cordial. And ambience is also good. But not coming for another visit.",negative

10381,"This is a small eatery located in the lanes of Laketown, just beside a park. To be honest it has a very timid and a bit of shabby outlook with a menu which mostly caters to bengali taste. Once I was famished and decided to try out something over here, and me and a friend ordered a plate of schezwan noodles and a plate of crispy chilly babycorn, both which were priced according to a restaurant's range. Only if the taste also matched to that of a restaurant. The staff are impolite and they took nearly 20 minutes to just serve the noodles, which did not have even a hint of schezwan flavour in them, and another 15 mins to serve the babycorn, which was practically raw fried. We decided not to eat the babycorn for obvious reasons, but had to pay the amount totally as they were not even ready to listen flaws in their food standards.",negative
10398,"**Location**

Gariahat Cornfield Road, kolkata 19

**Ambience**

Well it has both dine in and take way options. The Restaurant is on the 1st floor. Its a small joint with a cozy ambience .

**Food**

At first we ordered Crispy Chilli pepper salt fish as starter. Its a must have I must say.It has got a smooth coating with nice aroma of pepper.

Next we had Chilli fish gravy and Mini hut special fried rice.The chilli fish tastes quite authentic while the rice is again a must have. Its filled with crispy fried cottage cheese and Cashew nuts which add a different flavour to the dish.So a big thumbs up for the Chef Special Rice .

**Service**

Food was served on time and the service person was courteous too.

It may be a small joint , but don't judge it with its size. If you're in search of a pocket friendly restaurant with good quality food , this one is for you.üòä Good Luck.",positive

The chicken wrap and burger were mind blowing and the best served. We also had had 4 huge pieces of crispy fried chicken....This can compete with kfc crispy chicken but it's tooo oily the only flaw here.. you also get 2 pet coke bottles !!

Chicken Biryani from Arfa restaurant surprised me and took me by a huge surprise. Located opposite to Aliah, they are doing one thing way better than them. The biryani was fresh, chicken was sumptuous, potato was well cooked and rice was, well, how biryanis are actually supposed to have. The aroma, color, taste, everything felt so close to perfect.
Chicken Biryani here is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Even roadside biryani shops made better biryani than them. The rolls size is quite big comparatively than other fastfood centre and it's tastes not that much bad. Tried fish finger and fish fry but very hardly found any portion of fish. They make the noodles awesome for that only i am putting 2 stars.

1. Pork Steak with Broccoli (4/5) : The steak was fine, but not the best available at the price.
2. Chicken Steak with Mashed Potatoes and sauted Veggies(3/5): The chicken steak was a bit undercooked, but the taste of the sauce kind of made up for it. Has room for improvement.

KIWI
CRAZY BLUE
ORANGE
ALPHANSO MANGO

Among the Wok we tried-

FLAT NOODLES WITH SHRIMPS IN VOLCANO SAUCE

HAKKA NOODLES WITH CHICKEN IN SCHEZWAN SAUCE

HAKKA NOODLES WITH CHICKEN IN HOT CHILLI SAUCE

RICE WITH BASA FISH IN SOYA CORIANDER SAUCE.

They need to improve the sippers,instead of adding soda they can add Sprite which will taste better.Among the Wok I liked the Flat Noodles ones the most,Hakka was good too,
Didn't like the Rice base.
The plus point is they use fresh vegetables and proteins.The Wok remain hot for a longer time and the large Wok is enough for two.",positive
11126,"Introducing the Purple Wok Co. in Kolkata for the first time. Located in Camac Street. They have small cosy outlet with tiny lights.

They have tremendous variety of options to choose from. Different sauces for different taste buds, plus the perfect ones for kids too.
From spicy to sweet, flat noodles to rice and various sprinkls to enhance. Veg lovers can get their hands on paneer, and non vegetarian can select from chicken, fish, prawn and eggs.

Chef's special wok it worth a try, but you have to be very particular while choosing your sauces, that's what changes the game! We made our own wok and tried as much as we could.
We tried almost all the sauces in the menu with flat noodles and rice.

Their kiwi drink is a must try! It was so refreshing!

11170,"A regular dinner from this pocket friendly dhaba near bijan setu Kasba proved to be decent. As the day called for a vegetarian affair we zeroed in some regular and irregular paneer delicacies, a mushroom tikka along with 2 packets of veg fried rice and 2 masala kulcha.
The paneer lababdar is thing to behold with the spice, texture and everything going well. The Dhaba 24 special is a mattar paneer dish heavy on spices. Not that good not that bad either.
Coming to the chilly paneer - it's a little of base with the paneer not going well with the gravy. The gravy tastes good but it needs to be a bit thicker.
The veg fried rice is on point. The mushroom tikka is good both in terms of flavour and quantity.
The kulcha isn't right. It basically was a paneer stuffed parantha which isn't worthwhile.
All this was enough to tame the hunger of 3 hungry souls and 1 not so hungry soul within a budget of 800.
It's good alternative for regular when you're tired of cooking and need a relief.

11278,This place is actually a hidden gem. Looks like a private dine out. The food quality and quantity is great with such a pocket friendly menu. The staffs are courteous and service was prompt. I would definitely like to go over there again and again.,positive
11279,"Had ordered 2 butter masala dhosa,,. The dhosa cost around 100,. It was decent in size,. But felt 100 was a little too high,. The sambar was a little too tangy and the coconut chatni was not at all good in taste,. 100 bucks for the dhosa from this place is definitely not value for money,.",negative
11285,"Nu Wan Li is located right opposite to Bank of Baroda (beside Hazra Law College). Previously, I have tried their Kung Pao Chicken, Chili Chicken and Wanton Soup. And this time, I tried their Machow Soup and Crispy Chicken. So. Good. I would especially recommend their Chili Chicken and Manchow Soup. The Wanton Soup, though, was a bit bland. The food wasn't very heavy on the wallet, but really good portion size and delicious. Not to mention, it's very accessible, the staff is really friendly and service is really quick! Will visit again!",positive
11299,"Not that much of a good experience!
Prices are little bit on the higher side.
Ambience is on personal preference, but i didn't like it that much. Mainly this place is for consuming hookah as the whole place was filled with smoke because in each table there was a hookah except ours!
However quality of food is what i liked!",negative
11307,"Bloody hell !! I‚Äôd have slapped the manager if possible, the chicken wings were stale, blood clots were still present. The sandwich was good, but the chicken wings were NOT AT ALL in a proper state. I urge the Zomato management to immediately remove the restaurant from your list.",negative
11329,Ordered strawberry and chocolate shake.Both were good but I think according to the price it could have been better.Anywaz worth a try.Good luck Bellyfu and a Big thanks to Zomato for the offers.Keep them coming.,negative
11330,"Never order pizza from this place . It's horrible. First they use readymade base . we did an add-on of veggies and extra cheese for cheese corn pizza. Everything was sticking inside the box ! And it did not look like there were any extra veggies are cheese. Totally disappointing. Second , we had Mac and cheese. It lacked salt and seasoning. Top of that quantity was not worth the money they charged.",negative

11343,"This cafe is situated opposite to CCD, Esplanede. Decor is very cool,perfect ambience for a hookah lover.¬†
But food quality is average.We ordered veg hakka noodles,chicken italian pizza and sahara mix fantasy hookah.Hookah was good. But quality of noodles and pizza need improvement.
They also dont give you regular water. Only mineral water is available.
Price of food and hookah are reasonable.",negative

11394,"A great fast food and tandoor joint.
You can know about its popularity here by the crowd it accumulated around it. And I am sure u can not resist the aroma of the tandoor if you pass by the joint.
It has been a lot of time that I was going for something else but the aroma of tandoor just pulled me towards it and finally I ended but eating tandoori chicken here.
They are not only the best in tandoor but they serve alot of fast food items as well but what is the best thing about this place is its MoMo, chicken mo os are the best here and I eat it alot, in bulks. Yaa, I forgot about the biryaniüòãüòãüòçüòç
All in all good food decent pricing. Good service and decent ambience. ü§òü§ò",positive

11403,"I have tried their biryani, and all things considered, it is rather good.
Egg roll is made with a fluffy lachcha paratha. They make it well and add some spices to make a difference.",negative

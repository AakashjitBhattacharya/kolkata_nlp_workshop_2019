7,"The best one till date existing amongst all the buffets in kolkata.has been there almost 4-5times.the live grill session is not an unknown thing to Calcuttans.i would like to emphasis about the Greek festival which was on.
Food was great,the live Malpoa session could have been a bit better.",positive
15,"Went there for Christmas lunch today.Not quite sure what i liked about this place.Had to wait for over an hour to get table for two.Anyway that can be overlooked still nothing about this place appealed to me.We tried the original chello kabab & bloody mary.The chello kababs tasted very average to me.. i quite didn't understand what is all the hype about this dish so much that too at present.I actually didn't like it at all.Lighting here is not relaxing to me way too dim.In short not my kind of place to chill & dine. Definitely an overhyped eatery.

P.S. Please hire professional,trained,well mannered staffs as the staffs in the waiting area are very impolite which makes them unprofessional.They should learn professionalism from the professionals of 5 & 7 star hotels.Being in the hospitality industry is not everyone's cup of tea.",negative
27,"Nice ambience.. Options in Indian whisky is very less. Food quantity and pricing is very good.. Enjoyed the live performance... Great view.. Didn't like the attitude of a particular staff who was taking my order. Told him net connectivity in your tab is not good m unable to place order. Even then he tried to show as if we don't know how to order. The sentence was ""are kaisa  nai hoga sir"".. Didn't expect this kind of attitude. Overall it was a nice experience..",positive
30,"This is a rooftop cafe near golpark. The place is open and the view from the top is outstanding. Firstly if we talk about the ambience the seats and glass walls make for a perfect experience. If you visit at night the night view of the city is clearly visible from here.
As this place is crowed always you may have to wait for your chance they will give you a buzzer in the waiting area and when your turn comes the buzzer rings.
The food here is good and they also serve alcoholic beverages. But apart from good service and food the ambience is the reason why it got 5 star from me.
Honestly speaking the prices are a bit too high they probably charge you for the novelty of having your food on a rooftop.",positive
41,"I currently went in for the Great Biryani Festival here and they had 5 types of biryani- Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Biryani, Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani and Afghani Biryani. We ordered all of them and my favourite were the Tikka and the Reshmi ones. The Afghani Biryani has a flavourful rice with dry fruits and chicken whereas the Hyderabadi Biryani was a little more spicier than the rest with curry leaves and South Indian spices. The festival ends on 11th January, 2019, so give it a try. Each plate for ‚Çπ99/-!",positive
44,"Great food.Quantity is huge.Went there on the biriyani festival .Amazing hospitality.Great experience overall.Give a visit ,the food here is great.",positive
55,One of the biggest restaurants of the city. Catering to 400 covers at one go. The food is simply amazing here. We always go for the chinese cuisine. The taste and the portion size is just fantastic. This is the value for money kind of restaurant. Cheers team.,positive
64,"It was late night when we a group of five decided that we wanna have awadhi cuisine and so we landed here. As we reached there it was almost 10:00 and the last order was at 10.30pm. We were damn hungry and ordered mutton & chicken tandoori biryani, galauti kebab, lucknowi paratha, chicken tangri etc. As usual the food was yumm üòã . Talking about the ambience and decor it always reminds me of my city Lucknow where we have the nawabi essence all over the city, though we cannot find it here all over the city but ofcourse in Oudh we do. The wooden carvings, the coloured glass panels those Thalis in which people eat and in nawabi style it's called taslas reminds me of Lucknow. Whenever I feel like to eat the real awadhi biryani it's definitely only n only OUDH1590.",positive
67,"This whole place is themed after the mughals and they also serve mughlai food. The name also has 1590 in its name and the whole interior is designed according to it. A soft soothing music plays in background. The chair and tables are very good completely wooden and the ambience has a royal feeling.

The Biriyani here is very good. Mutton is the speciality here. The oudh special Biriyani is good and they also have one variation of Biriyani where it dont have egg or potato but it has shredded meat. And all Biriyanis are served in earthen handis and with them you'll get additional raita with them.

Now coming to the speciality galauti kabab. The story behind it is it melts in your mouth and tastes just too good.
The cutlery there also very good. Prices are a bit on higher side but totally worth it.",positive
68,"This place is a gem . Ordered their butter nun, murgh kasa, awadhi handi biryani and gosht mutton biryani . The quality is amazing specially the biryani . And it's light in taste as well as amazing , the quantity is good and the staffs are courteous .",positive
83,I ordered Chicken Biriyani from Zam Zam for dinner tonight as I had heard a lot about this joint however to my disappointment I didn‚Äôt like the biriyani. The reason being I‚Äôm from UP and we like spicy food..even though people from Kolkata think that this biriyani is spicy but hell no! It tasted more like rice and chicken with little salt. But this is because I love spicy food so you must give it a shot to know for yourself. :),neutral
95,"One of the sexiest place in town.
They sever a pretty good range of flavours in hookah, there food is awesome and the drinks are just drooling.
The interior is amazing and the ambiance is lit.

Loved the food and the hookah.",positive

123,"We were pleased to discover this restaurant¬†with its never-ending menu card with all possible permutation of combinations of food items but got eventually disappointed with their quality of food.¬†
We ordered one of their Chinese combos, Egg haka noodles with Chilly chicken and are surprised to discover hair inside it..¬†We couldn't cancel the order as we were already done with half of the noodles.¬†
The chilly chicken¬†was absolutely bland and tasteless..
We also ordered one lachchha paratha, one plain nun, and chana masala..¬†The nun was half-cooked. The paratha was good to taste but very hard... Chana masala¬†is full of oil but average in taste...¬†
The only thing I found good in the restaurant is that they have a fat menu card and provide food in large amount maybe appropriate for three people.",negative
140,"After such a long time , tried an excellent mutton biryani.......just 10/10, it marked it my wishlist a long time....as a starter we tried Multani Chicken Kebab.... Taste of this preparation mind-blowing..... As a side dish along with Biriyani we tried... Handi Chicken..... A1 experience for the very first time.... Must visit next time!!üòçüòç",positive
227,"Of what Kolkata biryani should taste like. 

Great packaging. Not very oily not very dry. Won‚Äôt feel the heat of the extra spices. Optimum stuff.",positive
247,"Heard a lot of praises about this place; while it certainly served delicious food with a unique twist, it wasn't as extraordinary as the reviews claimed.

We ordered their trademark specials - Dajaj Chermoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish. The former was four chicken leg pieces, beautifully charred and very juicy, served with a mayo dip. *Strongly recommended*.
The latter was basically fish fingers with a unique plating. It had a light fried coating due to the beer batter and served in a Budweiser beer can with an orange dip. I didn't really find this starter to be a standout.

For the mains, we ordered Coq-Au-Vain and Shepherd's Pie. Coq-Au-Vain is *strongly recommended*. The chicken pieces were plentiful and succulent and the dish had a rich flavour to it. My only suggestion would be to increase the quantity of the rice served with it.

Service was quick, and the ambience pleasant. Our bill came up to Rs 1281.",positive
256,"Very professional staff. Food is excellent and hookah is best in class! The electric atmosphere adds to the rewarding experience, if you're looking for that perfect hangout spot with friends.",positive
308,We ordered murgh lasooni kabab and chicken tikka butter masala.The kebab served was 6 pieces only but tasted good.The tikka butter masala was also good in taste and quantity was sufficient for 2.Naan was also good.Pricing is good.At peak times the restaurant is very crowdy by college students.You may have to wait a few minutes during peak periods. Overall a nice experience.,positive
340,"Ok, Atlast they are in behala. Near sakherbazar petrol pump, this place is two storied, ground with take away, 1st floor sitting arrengment. With all the goodness of kfc, it is here, not much different from other kfc reviews.. Thanks.",positive
349,"A new place in the long list of restaurants in Sector 5. Located in the Globsyn building complex. Went on a lunch with family.

It was a mixed group and we ordered different dishes mix of chinese, indian, tandoori and continental. For starters we had Fish in Housing sauce and Murgh reshmi kebab. The fish was very tasty cooked with perfect of sauces. Then we ordered pizza, thin crust and with generous toppings of chicken.
Main course was dynamic for us, with mixed rice and kung pao chicken, nan and chicken makhani, pasta in white sauce, lamb steak and baked pomfret. So all the dishes were equally good, however the stand out was the chicken makhani and the lamb steak. The decor is quite nice with a mix of high stools and normal tables. At the time went they did not have the alcohol license so were only serving mocktails with a quite a few options. To me it's one of the best multi cuisine restaurant in town right now.",positive
350,"The food here is pretty decent with a good service. The food is delivered quite fast. Most of the items on the menu are available. I loved their service.
The only downside was that, the floor seems a bit dirty.",positive
374,"Beside Xavier's back gate, this place is located on the first floor above kurry patta.
Good ambiance
Food was good.
Quantity was also good.
Staff is courtesy.
Service was late.
Over all rating 4 stars.",positive
391,"Well I have to consider this place for cheapest price with good food quality. I visit here often. But the best we had was Lachcha Paratha,Boneless Chicken Bharta and mutton liver masala. They have some space crunch so you have to calculate the time including when you are getting the table. So you have to control your hunger till then üòãüòâ",positive
396,"The pizza was delectable and surprised me entirely because I only find thin crust everywhere, I don't know if it qualifies for 12 inch pizza or not but the taste compensates for everything.
Now the burrito was entirely the opposite as it kept falling apart. The filling was A1 , though the quantity of chicken seemed less but flavour wise was great. Hope they would make better burrito wraps in the future.",neutral
404,I often order food from this place. The Biriyani is okay. The chicken side dishes are good. The price is affordable. One might check this place out.,neutral
407,"Its is located at Behala tramdepot and it is possibly one of the oldest restaurant of this area which served biriyani. I have literally grown up on their biriyani. It was long since I have visited the place so decided to order q mutton biriyani through swiggy. The taste was as expected, the quantity was good,the mutton piece was succulant and tender. I was not dissapointed at all",positive
417,"Went to this place on Sunday and tried out their buffet
To beginwith I would like to say that they should improve both quality and taste of the food.
I was here with high expectation but to be true it didnt meet my expectation.
The starters were not that delicious
Chicken was not served fresh
Same with the main course not that tasty; only i loved the ghost biryani
Desserts were also not upto the mark üòë
I would not recommend anyone to visit this place.",neutral
419,"I have been here twice now. All i can say is as the menu kinda remains the same, tough being a Sunday we didn't get pizza or pasta,the food is good. Buffet is good. The starters used to be better, the fish items were lacking taste.kababs or gravy no taste. Chicken items were good. Mutton was avg.
In the main course biriyani was good.

Dessert section was good too but could have been better. Phirni is good,ice cream are good. Mousse was disappointing.

Coming to drinks, the welcome drink was good. We used gold for some cocktails. Had mojitos and LIIT. both were average..kinda a disappointed hope they change their menu.
P.s only thing everyone liked was the paratha wrap.",neutral
420,Sigree global grill is an all time favourite of mine. The grills are sizzling in taste and the food piping delicious. Went there with family and had a gala of a time. Started with signature sigree grills and then relished the main courses topping it with deserts.. Hats of Anjan Da!!!!,positive
425,"Some food experiences are so good that you don‚Äôt know what to write. Pa Pa Ya is truly a fine dining experience in every possible way. They are having  a Christmas Special Brunch Menu and we were lucky enough to be there on 24th and experience it. While most buffets and brunches make you move around the floor, picking food of your choice, here everything was served on the table. This made a huge difference. The personal attendance at the table is very special and makes your experience super comfortable and relaxing. The only thing that I had to do was click good pictures and eat. The food looks perfect and tastes amazing. They use the freshest ingredients and that reflects on every dish. Overall a very satisfying experience. Probably will be back this weekend to taste their ala carte",positive
438,"This place is nice, though dimly lit which is not good for photos but the food is nice. The seating arrangement is nice and ambiance lighting is beautiful.
Ordered pickled beef , loved it...",positive
450,"Nawwarah Fine Dine & Lounge, is situated just opposite quest mall it is indeed paradise for vegetarians with very royal and classy decor full of bright vibrant colours. A live performance band was going on in the lounge section when I visited there. Food is indeed lipsmacking.",positive
451,"Came to knw about this place from Zomato. The reviews were too good. So opted to visit here. Though it's a veg restaurant but the variety is vast. They have separate section for family and hookah zone. So with kids also you can enjoy food if you like veg food.
The decor is very good. It's quite busy place filled with people so tabel booking is must. Service is bit slow but the rush they have i consider that part.
Now coming to food if you love veg cuisines do visit this place. The quantity and quality both are great. Price bit on higher side being a veg place. But the food makes it worth it.
For me it's a great place for my veg cravings.",positive
456,"Wonderful decor!! Very classy .. Very royal..!!
The food was good too. Pure vegetarian restaurant of such a level is hard to find in Kolkata.
Staff could have been more friendlier. They always seemed to be in a rush when there was need for none.",positive
457,"Though it's a vegetarian restaurant but the food here is awesome and delicious. I went there in the astami of Durga Puja 2k17 with my school friends and had a great time there. The food was too yummy. They served it hot. We took butter nun with a manchuriun like dish and we just loved it there.
About the ambience .. it's just awesome. They have given a great appearance of the place and we loved that very much. It was a great experience !",positive
467,"Ordered mixed fried rice. The packaging was good. The fried rice was different with a lot of fried garlic. It was good, a bit spicy for my taste. However disappointing was the absence of pork. When it says mixed and the restaurant serves pork we assume it comes with both chicken and pork. Atleast an option given to the buyers would be nice. Would love to visit soon and try baos.",positive
492,"This was my second time at the Irish house!
We visited during the happy hours which is from 4pm-7pm.
We opted for draught beer and long Island ice tea. The liit was the best I've had in Kolkata.
The Sriracha chicken pizza was AMAZING. It had oodles of cheese! The beer can roast chicken however wasn't as good as we'd expected!",positive
496,"Quite a fun place to be at with some peppy numbers keeping you at toes all the time and we indeed had a good time overall but what dissapointed me was the long wait to get a table even when quite a few were empty still for some odd reasons we were not allowed to sit there and were asked to stand n chill (clearly not my thing) and given high rise stools just beside the entrance making it very uncomfrtable altogether.Nevertheless we tried chicken cheese fries,chicken skewers,fish steak,french fries and the food was of great quality so brownie points for that.",neutral
505,"This is a small place close to south city. Even though we went on a weekday, we have to wait for some time. They have both indoor and outsoor seating arrangements. As it was summer time we choose to seat inside. The decor was nice and cozy with hanging lights inside blue coloured mugs/bottles (and hence the name i guess). We ordered 4 types of mocktails, 2 steaks and lasagna. Even then the price was not that high. It's really affordable.",positive
512,"This is probably the one good place in esplanade. Amazing city view. I am giving 3 only because major missing is hookah here. Had the 2 on 2 drinks offer, drinks were good. We liked the food too. Specially the fish mahi kebab, non veg platter and pepper chicken. The staff was okay not great.",neutral
527,"I was there a week ago for an office party(buffet). The ambience of the place is very good, neat and clean. The starter was good with exceptional mention for the chicken wrap, it was awesome. The kebabs were also nicely done. In the main course I tried the paella with a white chicken gravy item, the paella, a variant of the original version, was good. The main star for me in the main course was the crab curry, it was outstanding. The let down for me was the dessert section, specially the chumchum was not at all of good quality, it was very course, not the smooth-passing down your throat thing that we are used to. The only savior in desert section was the four variant of ice-cream, the baked boondi also did not taste good. I would really like to request the management to up their desert section. Overall it was a good experience...!!!",positive
536,"This restaurant has the quintessential feel of Bengal. Was my second visit here..went to fir my birthday lunch..initial one was at the Raichak..where I equally enjoyed the food and the ambience.

Talking about food..I must appreciate the quality of food however the quantity is less..so place your orders accordingly. In addition to the delicious food..the hospitality was also satisfactory..where I see a little scope of improvement.

Personal favourite- Gondhoraj ghol",neutral
538,It is the best restaurant we have ever visit. Beautifully decorated.. feels like u r in a zamindar's palace. Best restaurant for bengali food lovers and food quality is too good and severed hot and it's a very net & clean restaurant. But there is a one problem that we faced that is the service is not up to the mark. Staffs are very good but they unable to serve the foods properly. Must need to improve the service otherwise we had a very good experience. ‚ò∫,positive

The quantity was pretty well.. Even Two people can't finish one.. And it tastes heavenly.. Must try.. Hospitality is also pleasing.. Sudip Das",positive
552,Was really excited to visit this place because i loved Santa's fantasea and since both are under the same bmoerson basically.. its a very well decorated place having 3-4 floors. You have an elevator so going the height won't bother you. They serve you some exotic dishes which you may or may not like..it solely depends on your personal preferences. To me..the experience was so-so..,neutral
565,"Whenever you hear this name 'Aminia' what is the first thing that comes into your mind?????
Ohhh yess it is nothing but biryani....Aminia's 'chicken awadhi biryani' has its own flavour which is beyond comparison and if you want to start off with a great dish i would recommend u to go for 'chicken kasturi kabab'..the staffs are well mannered and this outlet of aminia serves you quickly.",positive
568,"This is definitely one of the best places serving various seafood items at reasonable rates. They have a good ambience and the staff was helpful.
We ordered:
1) Bansa pora mutton- This is their signature dish. It was amazing.
2) Oyster chilli basil squid- I would highly recommend this to those who love squid.
3) Malaysian seafood rice- This rice compliments the oyster chilli basil squid so well.
Thus, it was a great lunch for us. ‚ù§

570,"Well.
Another bookmark ticked.
Amidst lovely set up at golpark. With an amazing menu ..This place is just amazing
We had ordered
Banshpora Magsho ( Mutton cooked in bamboo). Best part is that the dish is served in bamboo as well.
Next we ordered Tribal Rice. Unconventional and yummy..

We further ordered Soru Chakli which is made of flour and egg and is moist and yum.

Lastly onion payesh.. a bold combination and a nice one too..

All in all an amazing experience. Can't wait to bring more friends to this place..
Keep up the good work guys !!üíê",positive
573,"If you are searching for a perfect Bengali cuisine, this is a gem of a place for that. You can choose from a variety of items, and trust me, each of them are equally amazing ! We went for the buffet and I am very much impressed by it. The picture of the items in buffet is provided here. The fish fry was perfect. Simply perfect. Chanar kofta, and chingri malai curry and paanch foron murgi were perfectly upto the mark. Alongwith the dessert in the buffet, we also order nolen gurer icecream ( simply tastes heaven ) and baked sondesh. The aam porar shorbot was so-so. This really disappointed me after having such a great lunch. It was very much plain. They can probably work on it a bit more. Worth a try.",positive
585,"I have been to this place for breakfast so missed the live music and board games but didnot miss on to good food. The samosa chat mix, baby spinach corn and cheese, french fries with mayonnaise.

Will definitely visit this place again....",positive

617,"Went there around 6 months ago but forgot to give a review. The ambience was nice, cool and calm. The food was delicious and the quantity and quality both were perfect. The only thing that was not up to the mark was on of the waiter's behaviour. He was taking our orders and was behaving very rudely. Other than that, my experience was very good here.

Now coming to the food, they have to offer a wide range of sushi, ramen and what not.
I still have the taste of their California roll lingering in my taste buds. They also have a wide variety of cocktails available. I think their sangria red is one of the best I have tasted in town.

However,I could not taste the main course because they serve it only after 7pm and I went at 5pm.

Overall, it was a delicious experience.",positive

If you start tasting each one of them you will be full to the brim.What makes it even more difficult is the amazing taste and warm hospitality...they keep on serving you at your table.The atmosphere is casual,DJ is playing tracks,the view of the Victoria Memorial Hall and The 42 building through the glass pane and the countless lip smacking food,what more can you ask for?Visit this place for one of the finest Asian cuisine and leave happy and content.Five stars!",positive

3)Hot chocolate
4)Chicken lasagne
The grilled chicken sizzler was amazing. The rice , the veggies and the chicken just melted in the mouth. It's a must try dish. One of the best sizzlers I ever had. The hot chocolate and the lasagne could be better. The hot chocolate was not too hot and tasted like bournvta. The lasagne was a tad bit too salty. The Mexican chicken was spicy just as we like it. In my Earlier visits I had pizza, pasta and hazelnut latte. They were great too. The ambiance is amazing as well. For all the cafe lovers in town this is a must visit.",positive

The staffs were so polite and courteous. They handed us a huge menu and we were confused what to order. But I knew this place serves really amazing burgers so I never wanted to miss that. So the dishes we ordered were:

Big Fat Belly Chicken Ala Kiev Shots: Oh My God. Probably one of the best starters we ever had. It came in 4peices and was very much filling. Also this is their signature dish.Loved it so much. Highly Recommended.

Crumb Fried Chicken Burger: Already in love with their burgers. This was perfectly fried and crunchy and tasted heaven. Highly Recommended.

Cold Coffee: It was thick and tasted beautiful. One of the best cold coffees definately. Highly Recommended.

Overall a beautiful place to hangout. Loved it so much. I wish I could give them 10stars. Till now the best place serving some really good continental dishes.",positive
744,"I've finally found a place which serves butter naan just the way I like it. Soft, crispy, not too thin or thick, and with loads of butter. I'll definitely recommend the butter naan over here.

The paneer tikka lababdar was fantastic. I really liked how they didn't chop the paneer to tiny bits but instead gave big whole pieces of it.

The daal makhani tasted very good as well. I'll recommend both these dishes if you're visiting

The service here is good and the waiters are helpful and guide you with the menu.

Not too heavy on the pocket. I'll definitely recommend.",positive
754,Loved the ambience of the place. Staff is courteous. Good quality finger foods along with a full bar menu makes it the perfect place to visit if you aren't a huge fan of chaotic bars.

Now coming to the most important aspect - taste, must say I was little bit surprised when tasted their biriyani. I may not say its heart melting - out of the world taste, but its surely delectable, delicious, pleasing to your taste buds and enjoyable. Plus a very good quantity as well.

Now its been more than five time i have ordered biriyani, salad from Zoya just because of taste. If you want to have a pocket friendly decent taste lunch/dinner, then Zoya Biriyani would be best option in north kolkata.",positive

I usually avoid reviewing not so good experiences because frankly I don't want them to show up on my feed and leave a bad taste in my mouth (pun totally intended).

1428,Have been to Sankalp at different cities... So wanted to go to this place.... Ambience is nice... Menu as usual is same everywhere.... We had ordered cheesy crispy idly in starter which waa good... Achari rava dosa was good... Rasam Vada and Panchvarna Uttaapam was ok... Main issuenwas that white chutney was not good and very chilled.. They will lose out because a road side dosa sellers chutney is better.... Other chutneys were good but again chilled... They need to work on it...,positive
1433,"A tiny gem hidden in the busy streets of kolkata. Just in the lane opposite Forum Mall, this place gives u a peaceful moment to relax.
.
An updated and upgraded of a cafe. It serves you with good food along with ample choices of pastries and bakery items.
.
Cold Coffee here along with the Chicken Sandwiches are too good.
.
The service here is good, the staffs don't disturb you much and give you your little privacy which is very much missing from most of the coffee outlets in Kolkata.

If you want a place to chill with an intention to pacify with urself, this is the place.",positive
1435,"Small but very beautiful two storeyed cute cafe..nice ambience..sweetly decorated..located just a few minutes away from Forum mall.Perfect for breakfast/lunch/friends' meet/small hangout or chit chat session.
Staffs are helpful..food tasted well enough..when I was there,there was not much crowd..so had a good time there.
We took virgin mojito,cranberry cocktail and chocolate shake first..then we ordered french benedict,chicken cesar salad,devil's egg and sausage salami.The way they presented all those food was interesting.

Love the butter chicken, tandoori roti, mix veg.
They make decent Biryani as well, both chicken and mutton.
To my surprise, recently found out that they have n extensive Chinese menu as well. Tried the chilli chicken and Hakka chowmein once. Quite nice, both in terms of quality and quantity, for the price offered.
A must try for delivery options.",positive

1477,I was here few days back with my friend. It was empty in the afternoon. The staffs were cordial and the ambience is perfect with comfortable sitting.We ordered Hand Tossed Big Chicken pizza along with Green Apple Mojito.

1491,"‚Ä≠ ‚Ä≠well this is perhaps one of the best themed restaurant with Game of Thrones music ringing in your ears along with interior and decor but when it comes to food you need to serve best authentication to make your mark in the market.
Moving on to the foods we have ordered chicken soup was bland Ive not get any taste feom it.
Coming to the main courses their were jerky chicken presented where the chicken should have been more crispy and tender which in this case it was very hard and we have all faced problems while cuttig it.
Kahl‚Äôs platter was ordinary too bacon was not at all tasty and must be procured from a local meat shop it was full of fat and tasteless.
Lastly none of us liked American coupsey.
In the end I would like to share one important fact to the management if you cant improve your food you cannot charm your customers only by external attractions cause in the end only one thing matters the most while visiting a restaurant.",neutral
1515,Nafeel serves one of the most relishing beef biryanis you'll ever have at an extremely affordable price. The beef bhuna we ordered alongside however didn't quite live up to my expectations! Would go back just for the biryani!,positive

1533,"Decided to try this place since it serves authentic Bengali food. Really liked the way they presented their menu. They got a serving tray filled with bowls showing the items they serve. After asking the captain for their signature dishes, decided to try their Bhetki Bhappa baked (Fish), Kochu Patta Chingri Bhappa (Prawns curry) 5/5 and Chicken Curry 4.5/5 (forgot the name since i couldnt remember the pronunciation and i lost the bill). The prawns and chicken curry were my favourite pick and I totally enjoyed it. Bhetki Bhappa (2.5/5) was baked fish which my belly didnt really like, it had an odd taste to it and was too oily and heavy. The captain said it was one of their authentic hot sellers. Overall, a must visit place while in New Market area.",positive

One word. Khub shundor!! ‚ù§ You guys win hearts with food and hospitality.
On arrival I was given two options, either a buffet lunch or √Ä la carte menu. I chose to go ahead with the buffet lunch.
I was served with a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian starters which include kung pao chicken, momos and potato wedges with unlimited serving. I was also given to choose from a variety of mocktails.
The salad preparation was good. In the main course they had chicken, fish, lamb, paneer and Manchurian recipes, also fried rice and Thai hakka noodles which was prepared really well .
There were three to four varieties of desert and the cake was delicious.
A must try in Kolkata I would say for Friends, Family and love. Good value for money, very good ambience and very courteous and friendly staff. Not to forget, the alcohol! Cheers!",positive

Egg Biryani @ Rs. 60 (2.5/5) :

Recently ordered Egg Biryani from here, delivered hot in a paper box by Zomato on right time. Biryani rice seemed okey but not well mixed with spices and that didn't made it packed full of flavours. Potato piece seemed double cooked and became black while boiled egg was okey. Quantity was okey too. Overall it tasted very average.

General Zod's Grilled Chicken : contain 3 pcs Grilled chicken breast with veggies and not so good gravy. (Rating: 3/5)

1756,"I love Blue poppy.. so decided to try this place since it is in the same compound. Doma Wang is a popular name when it comes to tibetan and nepali food. The ambiance is quite good with traditional floor seating also. We went for their signature open momos. Visually very attractive but tastewise like normal momos only being less juicy. Pricing is also high for a plate of 10piece small sized momos it is 250 bucks. Nonetheless, we tried their Pork Thakali set which was very average and can be easily given a miss. I only liked the spicy dum aloo in the platter. The pork was blamd and no flavours. Overall an average experience",neutral

I ordered chicken tangri kebab and chicken tikka kebabs to go with my beer. I dint find the food fresh and price of the drinks was on average side .. they do have happy hours menu on drinks but beer are not included there, I hope they include it soon.. Hookah served was also not long lasting and hookah served was very small..
I would say there are loads of better options around that area..come here if everyplace is full or you want to have drinks at theeka price!",neutral

The chicken breast n leg pieces are huge n more than  enough for one.. 
Chicken wings are the best from in here

1821,"First dining experience at the Kolkata chapter. To sum it..the food was similar to other cities but the sevice standards were truly pathetic. The restaurant in Kolkata is perhaps the largest Peshawri. We were seated next to a table with around 10 diners...mostly foreigners. They were creating a total ruckus and the floor staff did not warn them for their decibel level...the luxury of being 'white' . Once they left...their table was cleaned, only to drop all the leftovers on the floor. This mess kept on lying there till we protested. The manager said the housekeeping was arriving. Does it need 10 mins for housekeeping to arrive. The service was slack...burnt papad was served and table not cleared. No one come to ask for repeat beverages. The cutlery was not unifom (the spoons were of two kinds) and furniture in shambles. Despite the good food, the service and environment left a lot to be desired...this Peshawri is best avoided.",neutral

Dragon Roll- cute small spring rolls with cheese filling .
Konjee crispy veg -different vegetables coated and deep fried
Shredded wonton salad - this was unique . It tasted like darshan had cucumber in it .

Main course

Egg wrap rice

Quesadillas were great and truly loved the generous filling of spinach and cheese. The tortillas were a bit crunchy and the warm cheese filling is sure to leave your tastebuds wanting for more. It was one of the best quesadillas I have had in Kolkata. [4/5]
The Pizza was truly disappointing. The crust was very dry from the first bite. Also, the cheese just fell off on being bitten. The combination of toppings chosen was good but these two factors truly put off the entire experience after having those great quesadillas. I hope they improve their pizza dough. [2/5]

You can read books, play your favourite songs on the guitar hear or even choose to click with the beautiful decor all around, every arrangement is here. I went here along with a friend. We didn't have much of an appetite and settled for a chicken cheese fries. Loved it as well and the portion was quite good enough for the two of us. We also ordered a chocolate peanutbutter milkshake and a choco frappe along with the food. The menu infact has a huge range of items in the beverage section. The highlight of the day was the creme brulee. It served on a plate with some blueberry compote and a shortbread cookie. Loved it. Must try if you are here. They also have a good all day breakfast menu here and the main course dishes on the menu will surely be good as well.
I however feel, they can add in a bit more in the starters.Maybe something with fish. A really nice otherwise to meet and have long conversations over some good food and coffee.",positive

2132,"I have been obsessively ordering double beef rolls and Bhuna beef kababs from this tiny place called Zafran. Hands down, beats most other places in town in tests of taste and portion size. A full plate of bhuna beef kabab (second photo) is 75/- and makes one hungry girl extremely happy. Served with some lime and onion slices, this was a rather satiating meal. The same goes into the beef rolls, and they are simply put together, with a couple of chillies on the side, crisp, flaky paranthe, and a bit of onion to add to the crunch factor. I am yet to try their biryani, but if the kababs are this good, I am quite sure the biryani would be quite good too!

The wide variety of combo menu's were a delight to us.
We had ordered
Lucknowi biryani
Hyderabai biryani
And
Chicken dakbunglow along with jangli Pulao :p

The lucknowi biryani consisted of egg and potato along with very soft well cooked chicken piece.
Though it could have been a bit less spicy.

The Hyderabadi biryani was on point.

The chicken dakbunglow was so scrumptious and so was the Pulao so soft!!

Overall pocket friendly. The chicken biryani was priced at 230 bucks and the combo at 270. This place deserves a visit.",positive

A Giant and a legend among the streetfood-shops of kolkata.
Everytime I go to kolkata, invariably I land up in front of this shop.
They don't have any seating arrangements. People either take away in small paper packs or eat the food standing nearby. All types of fried fish, egg devils , chops and cutlets - the Raj era specialities are carried on in glorious colour, here.
I have not found any deterioration in taste. Rather they are still having a high quality in size and taste. Brilliant.
It's surprising how they can focus on different people shouting orders at them and how they can notice and remember about whose orders are to be prepared earlier , as per when the person came! astonishing.
Sometimes it takes lot of time and frequently the items finish in a very short time and I have had to return empty handed.
Good work here.",positive

I've ordered normal Kolkata Chicken biryani as well as the Hyderabadi one. Both of them are good. It's really hard to find Hyderabadi Biryani in Kolkata but I appreciate the efforts of this restaurant to make Hyderabadi biryani in Kolkata because Calcuttan are very particular about their biryani and the aloo in it. To make a biryani without aloo in Kolkata needs a lot of courage. Kudos to Biryanne and more.

Now the two important things that you should know(if you are a first timer)---1. You have to make a membership card for ‚Çπ150 which will be valid for one year (without which alcohol will not be served to you) 2. You have to be an adult.

We went on to order the pasta in white sauce. Food was great! My friend had also ordered a takeaway from there. She was also impressed! Looking forward to go there again!",positive

But the decision was a complete disaster as the naan was burnt and oily, not soft as a naan should be but very chewy. Along with that the paneer preparation turned out to be some raw paneer cubes floating on a sea of oil and some thick curry paste which was totally tasteless. Moreover they didn't put any salt in the paneer dish which all the more contributed to my horrible experience. Couldn't eat my food after few mouthfulls and had to dispose it off to the bin with my money going the same way too.",negative

1) Daal Maharani turned out to be a delectable dish and a much welcome change. A wholesome dish in itself and sufficient to makes ones saliva drool. This coming from a hardcore non vegetarian like myself speaks volumes about its taste!

2) Murgh makhani though not close to the stuff I love in Delhi isn't very far from it either and I can safely vouch that this place serves one of the best butter chicken in Kolkata

I intend to visit the place again. My request to the management to maintain the standards and not dissapoint me when I visit them in person

therefore I ordered Shahi Paneer, Malai Kofta , Dal Makhni, Veg Pulao, Tawa Butter Roti, Rumali roti. The Service was fast because the Sabjis are Already Prepared before hand in a Large scale and as I Told it's great for takeaways. The Food is Cleanly Packed plus the Taste is Sober. I personally feel the Veg Pulao could have been better with taste.
I'm Rating it 4star because there are a few things which can be Taken care of like Sitting arrangements though space is less, the food if are Prepared beforehand must be Heated So that when the food reaches home it remains hot. And apart from these I feel this place is good to Order food. cheers !",positive

The appam are pancakes and they were soft and too good. We tried the plain and egg ones...I preferred the plain one more as it is lighter.

The paper dosa was much smaller than expected, also the waiter couldn't explain the differences between some dosa options

We had Chicken Chowmein(Hakka), Hong Kong Chicken and Honey Chili Pork.. Every item tasted superb..The only drawback the restaurant has is the service..which is very slow during rush hours..Other than that a must visit place for foodies.

5711,"Had to grab something quicker as my friend phoned me and told we need something gravy with less spicy. 

Asked a few people at the station and reached this non descript place - 3 minutes walk from Belghoria local station. 

The place was clean and well kept. First thing you notice about them is the crowd- takeaway food. This place is what you could describe as ""parar hotel"", mostly catering to the PG residents that thrive in the station area. 

Now , coming to the food. The order was confirmed swiftly. Specific instruction was given to make it absolutely minimal spicy. 

The chicken was nicely made. However, it seems the particular request fell on deaf ears. The gravy was made over the top spicy and generous amount of chilly slices were visible everywhere. 

Made things really hard for both of us, somehow we managed. 

Will I get the same item from them again? No! Not unless I get to supervise their cook lol. 

Pocket pinch? ‚Çπ140.",neutral

Ideal place for a group of friends to catch up for a chat or maybe a couple of school/college dating kids catching up for a pocket friendly snack.

The service is superfast and the waiters pay due attention to the customers. The chutney served alongwith masala dosa is thick and tasty and the same goes for the sambar dal. However, the potato stuffing inside the dosas is a bit soggy and due to that the dosas loose their crispness very soon. I would suggest them to use dry potato curry as stuffing to retain the unique taste of their jumbo sized dosas.That apart, the place is ok for a pocket friendly meal.",neutral

Another big attraction of this restaurant is the mouth watering Tandoori Rolls for which one can quite often find a long queue at evenings.
Now coming to the foods,all the items come in good quantity and specially the tandoor dishes are exceptionally delicious.Their speciality is the Diana Kebabs,which not only taste good,but also is treat to the eyes.Yes,so colorful the burnt texture of the Chicken wings appear to be that no one can fail to notice that.

We followed up by ordering the spaghetti aglio e olio (excellent), a margherita pizza (also good, and the thinness of the crust was appreciated) and a chicken tetrazzine (nice and rich, but not cloying).

The aloo tikkis lacked any flavor and were greasy. My mom, who tried the chicken katthi rolls was taken aback, too. The pineapple juice was watered down.

The thin crust Californian pizza is a great dish to order. If you are in for spicy food(well technically drink in this case) go for the unique mocktail 'Some like it hot'. The chocolate truffle in dessert would certainly satisfy your sweet cravings. A highly recommended place to visit!!",positive

Okay I must admit their legendary battered fish (aka Butter fry) is less fishy these days but once you break into their fish rolls you would understand why Bengal Hotel still stands tall among these new joints. Wonderfully fishy, a little sweet and a distinct taste of those two layers are what you will get from Bengal's fish roll, their best export I believe. Also do try their kosha mangsho with fried rice or crisp toast to get a taste of what old fare at Kolkata cabins used to be like. One of my earliest memories of eating out took shape here. That Bengal Hotel still tugs at my heart like the days of yore makes it a very special place indeed.¬†Small request: Pls do not ever change that name board.

The chicken manchurian was good but it was a bit salty, the pieces of chicken were very good there's no sign of floured mixed ones and last not the least the mixed fried rice was superb and delicious üòã, chicken, prawn, eggs and vegetables were added to the rice's ratio to compensate the amount.

Double cheese double veggie pizza(4/5): pizza made from hard crusted ready made pizza bread, readily available in groceries, usually proves to be a major turn down for me.

And from what I can say this place serves food that's a total bang for the buck. The taste was above average. I felt they should have incorporated more flavor to the noodles. But the quantity, man oh man the amount of chicken they added with the big heap of rice noodles is a big win-win for the both of us. The chicken was tasty, the vegetables were fresh (well, kind of) but the quality of the chili sauce could be better. All in all I won't say that I'm not satisfied. There's definitely room for improvement but what they serve and how much little they charge for that is absolutely amazing.

Honestly speaking being a true Bong , I love fish. Went there for a Saturday lunch with a lot of hope especially after going through all the reviews but sadly to my dissapointment it was not upto the mark.

However the food is just more than average. You can see what's cooking on here. Kitchen is just in front of you. They offer some types of noodles, which is not really bad, near authentic chinese cuisine.

On my last visit, ordered a plate of dumpling - seafood & mushroom. 5 piece of momos costs Rs 150 + 8 (GST). Though taste was quite good but inside of the momos were not properly warmed. Anyway it's better to opt for noodles - no experiment no bad experience!",neutral

7312,it is a new restaurant and the staff was very courteous and the place look very clean and fresh the food quality was also good and it is a decent place for us to visit with our family but my only point of a little dissatisfaction was its price range according to me it should be priced a little cheaper but I very well understand the restaurants perspective because it's a new restaurant and it is providing Quality Services so its cost is a bit higher so the prices are high too but all in all I really enjoyed this place so I would like to give this place 3. 5 stars thank you,neutral
7313,"The commonest items in a North Indian menu must be Butter Naan, Chicken Bharta and Tandoori Chicken. And that exactly was what we ordered at the Ivy Restaurant tonight, for dinner.

I don't know if it was because we were the first (and only) diners at that point of time, but the service was extremely prompt and thoughtful. I forget when I had had a softer, more succulent Tandoori Chicken than this and the Naan, more supple and cushiony. The Bharta too was delicious, but somewhat overshadowed by its awesome companions.

It was a wonderfully satisfying experience and in the manner of the Terminator, I too must iterate, ""I'll be back!""",positive
7331,"After a long gap I ordered mutton biryani from Rahmania, Mullick Bazar. It took a long time to receive my order. First of all the biryani came in a paper box. The box contains a piece of mutton, a potato and flavourful rice. Rice is very rich and full of spicy cloves. You can fell the spiciness of cloves throughout the biryani rice. Really loved it. The medium size mutton piece was soft, tender and perfectly cooked. Long gain of basamati rice was very much satisfactory. But the negative part was poor packaging in paper box and excessive use of Dalda. As I received my order late, dalda started to thicken the rice n eventually it lead the biriyani little soggy. This kind of biryani may cause indigestion and felt heavily overburdened.

7432,"Its a very tiny place, and they have tried to make the most of such a tiny place by dividing it into 3 sections, nicely designed, but the top section is a bit congested especially for the taller people, also it doesn't get the proper cooling from their AC, because of which they have a table fan above, which is quite funny in a cafe.

Now coming back to their food, I feel their menu is contradictory in nature with their name (PP's vegan). I mean we literally thought that they are gonna serve only the vegan food items going by their name, but the menu is not vegan, its vegetarian. Until and unless they mean something else by the word vegan (which only they can explain). 

Now coming back to the order we placed. We ordered one (nachos+pasta+soft drink) from their combo special, and we really liked the pasta (mix sauce)

Ordered a veg falafel platter and umali, coming to the taste its perfect, definitely the best falafel I have ever tried. Pita bread and hummas was also great and so was the salad that came along. The fries served were normal, didn't knw the name of the white and red dip, but that was amazing.
The umali I tried was my first, high on 'kewda' made with crushed bread, was definitely something new, though not a fan of.

When it arrived, I wondered if they have mistakenly served me a veg pizza. I decided to have a re check and after a few seconds I discovered few chicken chunks among the crowd of veggies. The pizza wasn't that bad in taste but nowhere close to Dominos. The crust was soft. But chicken pieces were very less compared to the amount of veggies they had put in. 198 bucks for that ain't justified.",neutral

Also don't miss out on the mixed sauce pasta which they will customise in any way you want.,positive

We gave the order of chicken hariyali kabaab. It was served hot,juicy inside and well garnished. Then we had chicken biriyani, mixed fried rice and lemin chicken. All the items were good. The biriyani need a special mention here, it was so tasty, less oily and served hot with raita.
At last we placed the order of sea water mocktail it was very close to a well known blue lagoon. The hot gulab jamun with ice cream was really good in taste.
Overall a well outing it was and would like to visit it again. The only flaw which i could mention is that they took around 20 mins to get the food ready, other than that all ok.",positive

1. Pricing: for an order of mutton biriyani, galda chingri (shrimp) malai curry & hilsa biriyani ‚Çπ860/- felt a tad bit higher
2. Quantity: pretty poor except mutton biriyani which was standard
3. Taste & quality: below avg to avg, the hilsa biriyani tasted extremely salty & without any actual taste. The chingri wasn't of good quality either & that just the lower half provided. The scourge of poorly boiled mutton comes back to haunt again
4. Packaging: delivery had leakages
5. Delivery: the guy didn't know the area or recognize directions and took almost 20-25min of talking for getting him to my home
6. Overall: just an avg to below avg experience",negative
8384,"Worst experience ever. Ordered chicken biriyani from this one and got fed up with my experience. I'm a pure biriyani lover , tried so many places but this is the worst experience ever. I don't know from which angle it looks like biriyani. There was no minimum fragrance of biriyani. You clearly will understand that they cooked the biriyani with some ready made biriyani masala which we can get in every grocery shop. Don't know how tasty the other cuisine are of this outlet but it was my first order from here and they ruined it totally. I ordered after checking the zomato rating so never expected this. Also the price is a bit high. Don't go for biriyani ever from it.

From the plethora of dishes, I restricted myself to Awadhi mutton biriyani accompanied by salan. Now, Hyderabadi biriyani does have salan as accompaniment but Awadhi? The biriyani was good and so was the salan. A new combination, rating of 4.5 is well deserved. I had a dish of fish but did not like the taste. So, 1 out of 5 there. The live counters of veg and non veg, especially for Kebabs were missing the chef. Was not able to taste them at 10:55 pm.
The desserts had 7-9 different varieties. Misti doi was typical to Bengal and it was good therefore. I liked the chocolate fudge very much.
The staff were polite and made the experience tolerable.
The price is very high.",neutral

Now I understand slow service if you have a full house but there was no one around except us . Maybe the Service guys had taken a nap¬† The masala vada was also not to my liking With all the wrong spices and almost cold and oily . I've had much better ones at various other south Indian food joints in the city. Aloo paratha was dry and The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing. Mr. Pai you should do something about the service and the sambar , rasam and chutney have loads of place for improvement¬† ..........One extra star because the Owner is a friend",neutral

Imagine a long drive, followed by a short swim and then exquisite Oriental Quisine waiting for you.

The Orient at Raichak on Ganges will provide all of that.
‚Ä¢A long drive to Raichak from Kolkata.

Thai Green Chicken Curry

I tried the Onion Masala Dosa, The Besan Pakoda, Channa Dal Pakoda, Onion Utthapam, Lassi and Pan. Some photos missing as my phone was out of battery .

The quantity of the food was good. If you compare it with the pocket pinch, you will find it to be very very economical.

9316,A pocket friendly restaurant with delicious veg meals. Starters and snacks were more delicious as Compared to main course. Food served here is more of sweeter taste.

9319,"We had booked a table in advance over here but still had to wait for 1.5 hrs to get a seat. The waiters were all flustered and showed lack of training in handling such a large group as ours (we were a group of 26 people). The service in the beginning was pathetic. Water was served in mismatched glasses. Tablespoon was given with soup. Starter plates weren't served to most while one member received a plate with chipped corners. 
But what was recommendable over here is the food. In starters, we had ordered crispy chana n lasagne. Both were excellent items, though i found the tomato in the lasagne a bit too overpowering. 
Naan n kulcha tasted good. Paneer was a disappointment. Daal makhni was great. Methi matar malai tasted bland n most of the people in our group didn't like it.

Veg Fried Rice -

It had peas, carrots and spring onions. Rice grains were long and was properly cooked. But something was missing as the taste was like normal rice or pulao.

Paper Chicken -

Chicken pcs were big and contained 4 pcs. The gravy was very simple (zero spice and less flavors) which seamed like soup. Chicken was hard which made chewing difficult.

We ordered Golden Fried Prawn, Shriracha Chicken Wings, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice and Double Fried Pork. The taste of Shiracha wings was okayish. Felt a little stale and smelly.

They kept telling us again and again ‚ÄúOlypub is open.‚Äù My question to the management- Are you the personal propaganda partner of Olypub?

Our only fault- we wanted to sit close together so that we could all talk while having dinner.

The cantons were nice but i felt stuffing could have been more, to me it was more of wanton sheet than the stuffing that came into my mouth. The chilli potato was nice and crispy ! It's definitely one of the best places for pork lovers. So do try their pork dishes. All in all it's a nice place with good ambiance unlike other tangra places.

10702,"A nice small kiosk just opposite of Eco space, They have a nice menu to go through.So coming to the ambience, they provide benches for waiting.The interior of the shop is decorated with posters of rock bands, a guitar is placed just near the cash counter, they play different kind of songs & music.So a open air seats scores a 3 out of 5.Coming to the service,it's bit slow.but they are friendly so not a big deal.so a 2.5 out 5.Now coming to the real deal FOODs.. we had Chicken pasta in white sauce,chicken olio Spegati,Cheesy chicken wrap omelet, Fish & chips & to cool down all this Oreo shake.Pasta was the main winner among them, Spegati was bit dry in comparison to olio Spegati,fish & chips was tasting bit bitter as they had sprinkled bit much chat masala over them,the egg wrap was good with chunks of chicken sweet peas.The Oreo shake was also good.could be little chilled.so a 4 out 5 for the Foods.
So in short a nice joint to visit occasionally.",neutral
10703,This is a small joint opposite to ecospace entry gate...this is more of a take away joint.. though they have few plastic chairs to sit...this place offers tasty fast food at a very cheap price... quantity is also decent...I like their fish & chips & egg vegetable Maggi...as this place is near my office...hence I keep visiting this place for evening snacks...ideally good option for people working in & around the area...,positive

10736,Food storey has taken a piece of my heart! I have been wanting to go to this place from quite sometime and finally I could manage to have dinner with my friends last night. The personalised service really touched my heart. The staff was very cordial. Coming to the food.. I would rate it 4.5/5. But the coffee pannacotta is to die for. It's the best I had till date. I will go back to this place again and again just to have the coffee pannacotta. The taste is still lingering in my mouth.

The decor is good, the waiters friendly, but the food isn't upto to the mark, especially given the fact that they claim to speicilaise in American food. What we ordered :
1. Pork Steak with Broccoli (4/5) : The steak was fine, but not the best available at the price.
2. Chicken Steak with Mashed Potatoes and sauted Veggies(3/5): The chicken steak was a bit undercooked, but the taste of the sauce kind of made up for it. Has room for improvement.

Ordered chicken biryani which was decided after taking a minute or two which, in turn, seemed to work on the waiter's nerves(a good loo k was received by my friend). The biryani was placed in front of us and the guy marched back to his post like an obedient soldier(not hearing for once what we were ordering next). For the food part, biryani was ok. A ghee ka tadka saved the grace somehow( it was not dry atleast)

10863,"The ratings of 2.9 on Zomato for this particular eatery might incite varied thoughts in the minds of Zomato users but the perspective should be very clear on what points a user rates.

Surely, this is not a premium range Chinese eatery and it is absolutely baseless to expect such taste or hospitality out here. However, one should keep in mind that, it is obviously better than the roadside vendor serving you his own recipe in the name of Chinese. Furthermore, you get to eat your food being seated which should be considered too.

The taste of the Chinese provided here is not a great one nor can it be termed tasteless. The behaviour of the staffs are okayish and it is a place for people expecting to have food to fill their stomach not their essence. It is generally filled with people of teenage to adult age group. The price they charge for the food they provide should be termed ""moderate""; but, it is actually an eatery for cheap food.

A visit only if you are too experimental!",neutral

Price wise, dishes are worth it..just giving 3 star instead of 4 because of very slow customer service. Every food was consuming much time before being served in table but staffs were nice.They told us in prior if any particular dish will consume a hell lot of time.
Coming to food, we tried lemon cortiander soup, crunchy paneer, veg pulao and raita.
All dishes were delicious..must recommended all.
Soup was different, unique & good.
Crunchy paneer was yummy too. Presentation was also lovely.

FLAT NOODLES WITH SHRIMPS IN VOLCANO SAUCE

HAKKA NOODLES WITH CHICKEN IN SCHEZWAN SAUCE

HAKKA NOODLES WITH CHICKEN IN HOT CHILLI SAUCE

RICE WITH BASA FISH IN SOYA CORIANDER SAUCE.

They need to improve the sippers,instead of adding soda they can add Sprite which will taste better.Among the Wok I liked the Flat Noodles ones the most,Hakka was good too,

Though the restaurant offers both Indian (specifically bengali cuisine) and Chinese cuisines, I prefer the former to the latter. And I would recommend the same.

Food? Italian to Indian,all food u can get in very reasonable price and enough quantity.
I had chicken barbeque pizza and pasta in Alfredo sauce(non veg) for two! And we had to pay just 410/-!! Can u imagine??
And, what I have to praise about their disciplined service!",positive

We ordered:

‚úîChicken Barbeque Pizza

The ambience is very dim and the service is quite slow. The food is okay.",negative

11369,"One of my friend's house is in Baruipur, so I went to vist her place and all of a sudden decided to visit this place.

This Cafe is located in a crowded market area, it's a bit tricky to find out. It is located on the 2nd floor of a building.

The ambience is moderate, it has a separate bar corner. The staffs are cooperative and helpful. The service is prompt.

The food quality is good and the hookahs are also good. They don't serves drinks.",positive
11378,"Intro : Calcutta Cafe is a bar just beside Yogayog Bhavan . Is a place with too too loud music - just not bearable .

Food - Once I entered, I just decided that the best thing is to move out fast and hence just had a beer!

11388,Again if you are a frustu  only then  go there . VAT-69  which  costs   rs 200 / 60 ml peg elsewhere  costs here rs  400/60ml peg . this is a dance bar with girls dancing & taking money from  clients . food is also costly a fish item here would cost you anywhere between rs 180 - rs 250  per  plate depending upon your choice . overall my verdict a certain AVOID unless if you have never seen girls dancing in front of you . extravagant  alcoholic prices coupled with  VAT & service  tax makes this place too costly in my opinion . if you are from the locality better go to AR han thai near bentinck street in esplanade . you will get your money's worth .,negative
11391,"Im really surprised to see Som's Fast Food listed in Zomato and with that it also feels good that, that Zomato not only lists big hotels and restaurants but also local fast food shops and sweets shops. It is one of the fast food shop of my locality. Initially when it was opened 2-3 years back everything was so good and well maintained. The staff.s, cook and food quality used to be very good and tatsy initially. I use to frequently have momo, chicken chowmein, moghlai paratha from there and my favourite was chicken lollipop. They use to make awesome chicken lollipop. But later on with time passing by, with lack of proper maintenance and management, everything has been degraded. The shops looks so shaby and unclean now a days. The old staffs and good cooks are not there anymore. ¬†All the items mentioned in the menu card is also not available anymore everytime. I also dont find my favourite chicken lollipop available many a times.",negative

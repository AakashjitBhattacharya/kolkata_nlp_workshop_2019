They have altered the taste of the dish.....you get minced chicken instead of chunks in their shawarma.....
Pricing doesn't justify the quality and taste.....
Hope they take the necessary corrective steps.....",negative
8405,"Situated at half minute walking distance from the Barrackpore station next to Haji Saheb restaurant. I went few times approx 10 years ago, inside is now changed. They added more seating area. I went around 7 ‘O clock, but the restaurant was fully empty. Actually it was good for me because they served food on time. I placed order for Mixed Hong Kong Noodles & Chicken Manchurian. Noodles was good, but the chicken was perfect, well tender, juicy and soft inside chicken.

We ordered Devilled crab meat, garlic fried Hakka noodles, and sweet n sour chicken. It was tasty no doubt but, Devilled crab meat takes the crown. It is creamy to a level where you would wanna eat more and more. Service and ambiance are very friendly and welcoming.",positive

2586,"Well this small outlet really took us by surprise.
Firstly we spotted it for the Selfie coffee, which is probably a first in Kolkata. We went for our evening snacks and ordered their Selfieccino..which was quite exciting as it a was first time for us having our picture on our coffee 😊
The coffee tasted good but could have been little more warm. The beanshot cafe special sandwich was quite good and sumptuous though!!!
They also have good options fkr dinner with Italian and continental dishes as well. And for such a small outlet their menu is indeed quite elaborate.
Also a special mention for their interior decor, minimalist yet very contemporary!!!",positive

Visited this cafe on a Thursday afternoon! The cafe is very beautifully decorated with sofas and cushions on them. The coffee and tea prices are really cheap! The food prices are okay but tastewise really good!
We had crispy chicken and coffee over there!
One thing is that the restaurant staffs are not that much aware of the menu.
But overall a must visit place!

9324,"One additional star only for the courteous staffs. The food was pathetic coupled with an average ambience. One example is of corn cheese balls - they mash the corn and blend it with cheese (though it tastes like blended corn mixed with milk powder), this totally spoils the taste and you end up neither enjoying the cheese nor the corn.",negative
5215,Had ordered onion capsicum pizza and cheese corn pizza.Onion capsicum pizza was okaish but the cheese corn was above average.Reasonable price but I think u should focus on the packaging part.I received the pizza but it was not so warm.Hope you will take care on it.Anywaz good cooking Refuel.Worth a try guys.,negative

1182,"I would have loved to give 4.5 here but no options. Trust me this is an amazing place. The decor, the ambience , the service , the food, the presentation and most importantly the taste were A+!!! 
Extremely high quality stuff with equally gray taste sums up this place. What I liked was the uniqueness of the food. 

Must Try : Crispy Prawn cheng fun. A jewel in dim sum category. Eat it with the chilli oil they provide and u can’t beat the taste. Excellent item 
Miss out on anything but not the Aromatic Duck ... this is a state of art product where a portion of dick is cooked and brought to your table for shredding it live. U eat it with the Pancake and u attend nirvana .
But your whole journey will remain incomplete if u don’t end it with chocolate and Raspberry delice!!! Out of the world.
A must visit for all food lovers",positive
3772,"This is one of the best rooftop cafes in the Salt Lake Area. This gives an amazing view of the city. The pool in the centre adds to the beauty of the place. It's best to be here during the evenings.

Apart from the ambience, the food is extremely good and is priced at affordable rates.

My favorites are :

• Barbeque Chicken
• Fish Tikka
• Marinara Pasta
• Brownie with Ice cream

The service is equally good and you can enjoy the food with the lovely breeze. I love coming to this place again and again.

7377,"If you're in a mood to drink your lungs out without a big pinch in your pocket, Bingo! You're in the right place. Offers on the drinks menu seems to last forever.

Food is a little better than 'Horrible'!!We opted for the safest dish i.e Tangra Style Chilly Chicken. Albeit it was the worst dish I had ever had in my life and took us to South India.
The dish contained curry leaves and the typical flavour which every south Indian gravy carries.
However the tandoori was eatable.

Ambience is okayish. Although on my both visit, I was the only female. But the crowd wasn't that creepy.

I'll visit again n again just to avail the amazing offers.

We ordered for rice, moong dal,alu jhuri bhaja, posto, beguni, fish fry, chhana kalia, pabda jhal, murgi masala and aam chutney. To top it up we also had baked rasogolla and hot gulab jamun for desserts. Food is good though the Fish fry could have had a thicker filet of fish and lesser coating.

1958,"I was here few days back with my friend. My friend suggested me this cafe which has newly opened their outlet near Deshopriyo Park. Before coming to food, I would like to mention about their decor and ambience. I really loved how this little cafe is decorated with cozy sitting,book shelves,frames,pictures and other artwork. We ordered-
Classic Chicken-The chicken leg pieces were served with sauted vegetables and garlic bread with egg. The chicken was very tender and tge sauce was too good. I would highly recommend this dish. Its filling as well as tasty.
Bacon Bellpaper Cheese Pasta- The pasta was cheesy and yum and it was stuffed with bacon till the end. Good in quantity and quality both.
The staffs were really friendly but the service was a bit slow and they lacked their efforts to provide tissues or ask for drinking water. And I hope they add on to their food menu as well.",positive

7612,"Ordered CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMOS from here, well they have a nice service and that is probably the only good thing about them.
.
The food quality was average and the momos lacked taste greatly. Secondly, who adds food colour to pan-fried momos? Now being a food taster it is very very easy to detect if a food item contains food colouring in it. Thirdly the preparation was way too spicy.
.
I do not recommend this place.

67,"This whole place is themed after the mughals and they also serve mughlai food. The name also has 1590 in its name and the whole interior is designed according to it. A soft soothing music plays in background. The chair and tables are very good completely wooden and the ambience has a royal feeling.

The Biriyani here is very good. Mutton is the speciality here. The oudh special Biriyani is good and they also have one variation of Biriyani where it dont have egg or potato but it has shredded meat. And all Biriyanis are served in earthen handis and with them you'll get additional raita with them.

Now coming to the speciality galauti kabab. The story behind it is it melts in your mouth and tastes just too good.
The cutlery there also very good. Prices are a bit on higher side but totally worth it.",positive

Located near padmapukur and is a place for Adda or gatherings.

The quality is decent enough, it is not much Oily.
North Indian cuisine be the best. They do serve other cuisines but North Indian food be their speciality .
Quantity is fine enough.
They have a moderate service due to the Rush they have .
Pricing is okay, they can do some changes there.
Ambience needs a renovation.

The french fries topped with chicken bolognese, cheddar and boiled egg and fried onion was a delight to eat. It had a new tangy taste. The green appletina was nothing special so is the grilled fish and the mousse cake.

Then came the biryani.My friend was halfway through his plate when he discovered a COCKROACH LEG. They gave lame excuses of it being a feather and took away the plate BEFORE WE COULD EVEN CLICK A PICTURE WITH THE LEG. I SHUDDER to think how many people ate that biryani today. When we called the manager, neither were they sorry nor they refunded. Instead they offered one cheap lime soda as a substitute for that COCKROACH INFECTED BIRYANI. If even after paying full amount I cannot expect good service , then it's better to not visit that restaurant. To those people, carry on with your business of duping innocents.",negative

Went there for a family lunch and our's was a pretty big group of 26 people. They arranged it pretty well, showing us to our respective tables. Service is quick and top-notch, didn't make us wait at all.
We opted for their lunch buffet. The starters were a delight, especially the fish starter as well as the chicken drumstick. Main course however was a bit disappointing. The spicy crab dish was the savior though, soft and crunchy pieces of crab meat served my taste buds right. The dessert section had a spread of custard, fresh fruits,darsan, pastries, ice creams of 4 flavors. I thoroughly enjoyed all the desserts, there was something for everyone , the sugarless custard was a thoughtful addition to this section.

The service though was an average. It took more than the adequate time. Overall the food was of great quality but it does require a little variety. The ambience makes up for other things. It was an adventurous dining..!!

Tried -

1. CNC Bomb's - stuffed and crispy cheese balls. This dish was really filled with cheese. And served with chutney.
Would rate 3.5/5

2. Mushroom Hara Pyaz - mushroom & spring onions cooked in a brown gravy. I liked the taste and the creamy texture but, it was too spicy. Every bite had chillies in it. Dominates the taste of the mushroom though. ( With masala kulcha )
Would rate 4/5",positive

Chicken Penne Pasta mixed sauce was pretty good. It was spicy, full of loudness which dances on your tastebuds. While the noodle version was tasteless and felt like dipped in a poop of sauce and oil. It lacked not only anything related to pasta but whatever it were, it did not taste or felt quite alright. One should stick to penne here.

Blueberry sundae, well, was more of a mirage. The cup was full of ice cream and cream with cheesecake only to be found somewhere on the bottom of the glass. Not that it didn't taste good, but it's quantity of blueberry cheesecake was almost negligible. A maximum of 3 decent scoop will make it disappear into thin air.

We had a special Chicken Biryani that comprised of two pieces of Chicken , Two pieces of Potato and a piece of Egg. Taste was fine , as I didn't find something special.

Next for the side dish we had Chicken Tikka Butter Masala which had 4 pieces of moderate size and the gravy was okay , Accompanying it we also had Butter Naan.

Overall to sum up in one word , it is only running due to its location and by it's brand name.

Oh yes only Indian - no Chinese. And I personally felt that it's a bit overpriced.",negative

A lounge-cum-brewery, GRID serves North Indian, Pizza and Italian delicacies. The menu has been crafted keeping in mind the global customers it attracts. It has put the name of Kolkata on being truly global. Starting with the interiors, they have a huge Lego-Bar, a microbrewery serving amazing beers, high chairs, a toilet in a shipping container and an electric atmosphere. The crowd and music here is maddening.

3886,"South Indian food is a genre as popular as Mughlai food in kolkata and that is the exact reason why there is no shortage of restaurants serving good south Indian food in the city. Naariyal panni is a new addition to this genre with Good authentic South Indian food but with a twist!
Owned by a former Masterchef India contestant Rashi Kedia, Naariyal pani is all about same old South India food with Drama!
Tikka on the rocks for example is a dish with Mini idlis skewered to look like tikkas and blow torched on grill.
The jalebi caviars are something totally different, jalebi molecularized into caviars with the help of liquid nitrogen giving out a cold breath with every bite!

But they disappointed in no section!
The food, the service, the drinks and the cocktails, all perfect!

What changes from outlet to outlet is the quality of food and the way the bar-tender’s ability to make the perfect cocktails! But this outlet definitely matched the taste and the quality with some other Biker’s cafe of Gurgaon and Delhi.

It is having a variety of starters from different countries. We placed the order of chicken pakora originated from poland and chicken pan fried momo of vietnam style.

A Giant and a legend among the streetfood-shops of kolkata.
Everytime I go to kolkata, invariably I land up in front of this shop.
They don't have any seating arrangements. People either take away in small paper packs or eat the food standing nearby. All types of fried fish, egg devils , chops and cutlets - the Raj era specialities are carried on in glorious colour, here.
I have not found any deterioration in taste. Rather they are still having a high quality in size and taste. Brilliant.
It's surprising how they can focus on different people shouting orders at them and how they can notice and remember about whose orders are to be prepared earlier , as per when the person came! astonishing.
Sometimes it takes lot of time and frequently the items finish in a very short time and I have had to return empty handed.
Good work here.",positive

For food we had chicken tikka with vodka sprite and chicken pasta in white sauce. The tikka was very tasty and soft. I will highly recommend this. The pasta was good but would have been better if the vegetables in the pasta were not raw. Around 8pm a pianist starts playing music. The whole experience was quite good.

Soup was different, unique & good.

7101,"It is a small but cosy new cafe near Gariahat's Arambagh. The entrance of the cafe is adorned with graffiti and is a very beautiful location to click pictures with your squad. The ambience of the cafe is perfect to hangout with your friends, play boardgames or break into a song of you have someone in your group who can play a guitar.

The food service was a bit slow but the taste of it made up for the time. Whatever came was over in less than a minute. For drinks we had cold coffee, Oreo Shake and Virgin Mojito of which three Mojito was okayish and the rest was good.

We also had French fries, Grilled chicken sandwich, omelette, pork chops, sausages and chicken wrap. It is very difficult to rate any of these as everything was delicious, specially the chicken wrap and French fries. The pork was average though and had a lot of fat for which I didn't like it much.

All in all the experience was really good and would like to visit again to try something else from their menu.",positive

When it arrive it came in a small box typically ""20rs mishtir baksho"". Rice tasted stale and mutton was omg ...so horrible. I feel sick after having it. The mutton had a foul smell and there was no meat but only skin. Yuck. Please don't ever buy biriyani from this place. I had to throw the entire food into the dustbin and I also got a full refund from zomato. Stay away from this restaurant.",negative

Recently visited this old eatery during this Durga puja with some of my buddies. The only thing can I say is, gone are the days when Blossom used to be great. We (count four) opted for three plates of egg chicken rice, one chicken manchurian and one chilli Fish.

Egg chicken rice was good in taste, so was the chicken manchurian. But the chilli Fish was below average, the gravy tasted absolutely bland. Prices are relatively on the higher side according to the quantity. Would like to visit again and hope next time will have a perfect dining experience.",negative

6905,"Ordered corn veg club sandwich and corn paneer club sandwich through Zomato delivery. Club sandwich means three layers of bread with two layers of filling. The paneer one was better in taste. Sandwiches were accompanied with lays chips and ketchup. Actually sending packaged chips instead of loose chips for delivery is a great idea as it prevents the chips from getting soggy. Food packaging was excellent with each slices wrapped in aluminum foil. But ultimately, it lacks taste. It contains a lot of mayonnaise and it decreases the taste rather than increasing it. Overall it was a good option compared to the price.",negative
5901,A stone’s throw away from Mahajati Sadan and located near Ram Mandir this was a find and rescued us from the severe hunger pangs of 10-12hr classes. I am a non-vegetarian from the hills who loves her momos and have never in my life had veg momos before. But I love their steamed veg momos. It’s delicious and they serve 6pc of momos for 30bucks alongwith 2 different kinds of sauces and soup. And it’s all delicious. This place is probably more famous for it’s pav bhajis which I tried but I love their momos more and would recommend the same. Also for non-starters this is a vegetarian only roadside stall but pretty clean and hygienic. They do have benches set out for one to sit and eat and really helpful and cooperative staff.,positive

The greek salad was served fresh along with garlic bread and i really liked that.

Had several stuffs off their menu namely veg cheese sandwich, cheese and corn sandwich, paneer corn and cheese sandwich, buttered toasts, jam toasts, tea and coffee and cold drinks.

The Banjara Aloo tastes something really different. Low on spices high on taste
Nargisi Malai Kofta is highly recommended as it is really great and goes well with garlic naan

10494,"Ordered Egg fried rice and Chicken in manchurian sauce from this outlet through Swiggy Pop! The food was delivered in quick time and the packaging was impressive with no spillage. The partitioned microwave-safe container definitely calls for some brownies points. But the reasonable pricing of INR 109 for this meal was justified by the low quantity of the egg fried rice! For a healthy adult that quantity of rice is pretty low, at least that holds true for me. The Chicken in manchurian sauce somehow made up for the low quantity of rice since this side had four pieces of boneless chicken in it and the gravy was nice and flavourful. Overall a nice experience apart from the quantity part. Would love to try something else from this outlet one more time, and hopefully the feedback will be noted and worked upon.

Just one thing I'll say, is that their service is a little slow.
Otherwise, thumbs up for this place.",positive

6619,"They will save your hunger by there food. we are too hungry that time, so we order chicken classic chinese noodles. it comes late, taste like roadside chowmin, and forget to say that they say it noodles but they sales chowmin.
where as roadside egg chicken chowmin costs ₹ 45-55
they charge ₹ 130 for it.
I didn't found anything classic in this. so as per price quantity quality is not good. But yes they save your cravings at late night, but price isn't worthy.
it's near golf green.

On another occasion tried their mixed sauce pasta. Too good. Creamy fulfilling and soft. Nicely cooked. Lots of quantity. They gave complimentary garlic breads along with it.",positive
1491,"‭ ‭well this is perhaps one of the best themed restaurant with Game of Thrones music ringing in your ears along with interior and decor but when it comes to food you need to serve best authentication to make your mark in the market.
Moving on to the foods we have ordered chicken soup was bland Ive not get any taste feom it.
Coming to the main courses their were jerky chicken presented where the chicken should have been more crispy and tender which in this case it was very hard and we have all faced problems while cuttig it.
Kahl’s platter was ordinary too bacon was not at all tasty and must be procured from a local meat shop it was full of fat and tasteless.
Lastly none of us liked American coupsey.

On the contrary I liked the idea of sitting inside and then going outside to chill. That way you can have a cosy ambience with a good light area to have your food as well.

Food, the most important thing is very good here, mostly the pork dishes. We ordered Pork pan fried momo, pork hakka noodles and roasted chilli pork.

☘️Chilli garlic chicken starter--I personally didnot like the starter as it was too chewy and very less in amount.The pieces were too tiny .
☘️Chicken hakka noodles--The noodles were well tossed with vegetables and very light.Though it could use more spices but it was very filling as a meal.
☘️Hot chilly garlic Chicken--The gravy in the chicken was light,flavourful and very well balanced.The flavour of garlic was quite evident and the chicken pieces were juicy and succulent.

The packaging was very nice and they even provided us with ketchup and tissues.The quality is standard but the quantity needs serious improvent.

Now That's What I Call A Zing!!!

It came on time. The quantity of rice is below average. Taste is fine. It had 2 pcs of ckn. The gravy taste like clorine bcz i think they used water which tastes like that. It was not mineral water.

I tried a few dishes here and loved all of them :

• Mac n cheese balls - The balls were crispy outside and were stuffed with oozing cheese inside. Totally loved them.

• Spinach cigar rolls - The rolls were crispy and were stuffed with spinach, corn and cheese. This was my favourite as the rolls were very well stuffed and the cheese simply melted in my mouth.

• Shredded chicken sandwich - The sandwich had shredded chicken with lots of cheese. Totally worth it.

• Nutella cinnamon churros - I fell in love with the churros. They were very well made and were topped with Nutella and ice cream. This was indeed a heavenly dessert.

I really loved the pizza and the crunchy chicken, both were delicious! The shake was not that good, nothing mint-y in the taste or oreo-y, had a taste of some sweet ice cream, BAD, the harissa chicken was also very very disappointing, quantity wise also too less compared to price, it all costed us above 900/- not worth it.. kudos to the guy managing it all, he was very considerate, constantly trying to satisfy us so brownie points for him!",negative

The starters used to be better, the fish items were lacking taste.kababs or gravy no taste. Chicken items were good. Mutton was avg.
In the main course biriyani was good.

Dessert section was good too but could have been better. Phirni is good,ice cream are good. Mousse was disappointing.

Coming to drinks, the welcome drink was good. We used gold for some cocktails. Had mojitos and LIIT. both were average..kinda a disappointed hope they change their menu.

As this place is crowed always you may have to wait for your chance they will give you a buzzer in the waiting area and when your turn comes the buzzer rings.
The food here is good and they also serve alcoholic beverages. But apart from good service and food the ambience is the reason why it got 5 star from me.
Honestly speaking the prices are a bit too high they probably charge you for the novelty of having your food on a rooftop.",positive

When i opened the Biryani Container the look was not at all pleasing. i know how much hardwork it takes to make a Biryani but your entire work goes in vain when you cant provide which the customer is looking for or even near to that. Biryani tasted Little Bland and was little sticky as well. Chicken Butter Masala was a shear Disappoinment.. Who gives Chicken Butter Masala with Bones?????? 
One plate of Chicken Butter Masala with only 4 pieces and all are with bones.. Are you Kidding me? 
Very Very Oily indeed even mixing it with the biryani cant even save both the dishe's taste.
Really a very bad experience. Disappointed.

And not just the food, I loved the ambiance too... Just go and visit their pujo special menu : dashabhuja...

Now if you ask me to give it a rating, I'll give 5/5...",positive
7816,"Had an unpleasant experience when I visited this outlet for the first time. Their mixed gravy noodles was just horrible. However, after writing about my experience on Zomato I received a prompt reply from the management and I was also delivered a mutton Hyderabadi biriyani as compensation. The Biriyani was awesome and satisfying. Loved the combination of all sorts of flavours in it. This more than makes up for what I had to go through the first time. Thanks, and I'll definitely recommend everyone to try the Biriyani. I will surely order again. Keep up the good work, we need more restaurants like this in the neighborhood. :)",positive
8024,"My friend had ordered fish begum bahari and prawn in hot garlic sauce. In spite of accepting the order,the restaurant had delivered only hot garlic sauce since the fish begum bahari was out of stock.At first they agreed to take 20 minutes more to prepare the dish and after half an hour they stated that they were unable to prepare the dish within the time and refused to refund the amount which was already paid. This is extremely unprofessional behavior from the restaurant as it resulted in overall delay of the delivery. The screenshots are attached herewith.",negative

When I come to the egg-chicken roll, I didn't like the sauce they use. It would have been better if it was a little less sweet as the lachcha parathas they use to make rolls also contain a touch of sweet taste. Other than that the rolls were good. They used good amount of eggs and chicken.",negative

In two words filling and satisfying.

The Menu had everything Asian (from Chinese, Malaysian, Thai, Japanese). Finally ordered Bali Prawns (Indonesian), Seafood Salad (Thai) and Oriental Chicken Toast (Chinese) along with Beer and Sex on the Beach (Cocktail). 
After a long time, I had some good Bali Prawns - my favourite still is the one from Lemon Grass at Hotel Mayfair Lagoon, Bhubaneshwar. Kudos to the Chef at Fung Shway.
The Seafood Salad was a bit blunt - maybe our choice was not proper. It had shrimps, calamari & something else which we couldn't make out.
The Oriental Toast was again delicious, though bit heavy. The sauce was awesome as well.
The cocktail also didn't taste good.  
Next visit I'll try some main courses & update further. Cheers....",positive

Yesterday i gave momma a complete rest from making dinner and ordered from here.
Not too much but Chilly Chicken Gravy and Veg Hakka Chow.

Not disappointed actually but they can do much better i hope.

5237,"Ordered mutton biryani and chicken reshmi kabab through uber eats. Firstly, a thumbs up to uber that they delivered from kalikapur to salt lake in 50 minutes.  Coming to the food, the chicken reshmi kabab was very average and nothing special. In fact , the chicken pieces were not that juicy and tender. But, the mutton biryani just made up for the average kababs. I will rate it the 2nd best biryani in Kolkata, the India restaurant definitely being the best. The ingredients were good, less oily, the aloo and the mutton pieces perfectly cooked and soft, the subtle spice...overall it was a perfect biryani experience. As Arsalan and Aminia have lost their charm (and the variations of Kolkata biryani which Kabuliwala and Oudh 1590 serve does not excite my taste buds as much), if Enamiah stays this consistent with their biryani everytime, perhaps they will be at par with India restaurant in my books. Go give their biryani a try.",positive

Going through Hatibagan everyday I had spotted this very restaurant and wondered how will it be like when on 31 August 2018 after watching the movie Stree I dropped in here. The masala naan was pure love alongwith the chicken lababdar garnished with egg. The butter naan was the typical type but the only one which didn't live upto my expectations was the lachcha paratha. Hopefully I'll get a better one the next time I drop in here.,positive

Cappuccino and Chicken Tikka Sandwich.
Both of the items were superb.
Till date, I have experienced that much aromatic and smooth cappuccino really very few times.
The Chicken Tikka Sandwich was also very much tasty with that much stuffing.
But the best part about the cafe is its ambience. Rabindrasangeet, dim lights, photographs everything were just perfect to make one happy.

I am giving the five stars for ambience, food, stuff and the all..

Hope to visit again.",positive

- cost was pretty ok
- volume pretty high

- mutton is TENDER & WELL COOKED(better then most joints, that's a rarity!!!!
- timely delivery
- special mention:- Paneer Do Pyaaza

9804,"While strolling casually with my best friend, we felt some sudden sweet cravings and hence walked into this place - On My Way based nearby the Reliance Fresh supermarket based at Bangur. This is a pretty small outlet serving variety paans, litti chokha, waffles, shakes, kulfi etc. All they have for seating is a couple of stools and no tables at all.

Hardly any types of paan were available – other than their signature chocolate paan and hence, we had no option but to go for that one only! This was the regular meetha paan with great stuffing enclosed within a hard chocolate coating - fine on taste. Pro tip would be to eat it when semi-cold, neither room temperature, nor frozen!

We wanted to try out a few kulfis, but sadly, hardly any of them were available and hence, we made a move!

Hygiene seems a concern at this place, also, seating being a major issue! Staff could be more proactive. Prices are not high, quantity and quality served is fine, though availability can be improved!",negative

Hello guys!!Few days back visited this well known place.Beer lovers a shoutout to you guys!!

Place: The Irish House

Location: South city Mall

Pp: 800 for 2 without alcohol

Cuisine:European,American

What we ordered:
✔Portofino grilled fish:Grilled hot chilli pepper fish served with portofino sauce served with potato mash and string beans

✔Grilled Sriracha chicken bowl : Sriracha glazed grilled chicken served with Apple cider rice and glazed broccoli

✔Tangerine mojito: Orange juice along with fresh lime and mint

Hospitality:I was upset.Not upto the mark.Very laid back.

Ambience:A big space decorated with wooden furnitures along with dark colours like green and red on the wall.Very funky quotes related to beer adorning the wall adding spark to the place.DEFINITELY a place for beer lovers.

Taste: We found the food ok and over priced.Apple cider rice went well with the Sriracha chicken imparting a unique taste.Fish was nice.

Rating:3/5",negative

3782,"Located at a very crowded place at Choumatha, Madhyamgram. Very easy to locate. The place looks simple yet pretty. Sitting arrangement is nicely done.

Ordered the following:-

▪Grilled Chicken Sliders - The bun which is used in the burger is not a burger bun. It is more like the normal burger bun which you get in local stores which is clearly not the bun which should be used in a cafe. Yet it tasted good so if the taste is concerned their is no complains.

▪Chicken and Cheese Pasta - The pasta sauce tasted more like maggi masala I don't know why. But it tasted okaish. Quality was okay and it contained good amount of chicken.

▪Chicken Hot Wings - The taste of the wings was really good. I just feel the quantity should have a been a bit more.

▪Fries and Coke Combo - This combo is good. Rs 90 for Fries and Coke is value for money.

All in all this place serves pretty basic food. Nothing awesome. The prices are reasonable but not value for money. A pretty average place.",negative

2.triple chicken mix- loaded with three types of chicken, tasted freaking amazing. It was one of the best chicken pizza i had. The pizza sauce is amazing as well. Very cheesy again.

Everything was so nice,specialy that mozzarella cheese roll,so yumm and one of the best part that i liked most was humble and warm nature of staffs, they were so polite, we talked with Mr. Pallav ,he served everything very politely. All these were so good. And recently they started tandoori chai which i missed but i will try next time definitely.",positive
963,It is located inside the Mani square mall and I visited it along with my family for dinner. First thing that attracted us to this place is it's retro style decor and live band playing music inside. The food turned out to be very good. Soup was ok but then main course was good. Overall we had a good time with lovely music in the background. Worth visiting.,positive
10559,"Ordered paneer tikka kabab, America chopsuey veg noodles and lassi. The food was quite good. No complaints with the food. The amount,the price,the quality all up to the mark. Very good I'd say.
Only complaint is about the ambience. The a.c wasn't cooling properly and it's a small place so it was kinda stuffy inside. And it would be better if the food was served quicker but I guess that's not an issue since it was made right then so the food was fresh and hot. That's why a 3 star. Would have easily been 4 but for the ambience and the time it took to serve food.
But again, very much satisfied with the food.",negative
2013,"Pepper chino a cute bar cum restaurant is serving good food with wide range of cocktails .
Snacks . They have both buffet and ala cart menu.
I tried both .A total of 55 people can sit here . Ambience is nice with fancy lights all around . Things I found quite unique from the menu are

Dragon Roll- cute small spring rolls with cheese filling .
Konjee crispy veg -different vegetables coated and deep fried
Shredded wonton salad - this was unique . It tasted like darshan had cucumber in it .

Main course

Egg wrap rice
Shanghai noodle
The Shanghai noodles was spicy hence I loved it
Rice dishes were good nothing exceptional.

Pepper Garlic chicken
Kung pao chicken
Both these dishes were decent

Darsaan with vanilla - A well known Chinese dessert ,good as always .",positive

And rice could be eaten by two people like me. Bow coming to the quality, I don’t have anything bad to say or complain. Everything tasted amazing. Best part they used long grain rice for the fried rice. Chicken pieces were so big. Gravy was super tasty and yummy. The entire thing costed around 400/- I’m gonna order many more times from this place. You made a happy customer.🙂

1963,"The grub club is pure nostalgia as I started eating in this joint when it was established in 2002-03. The food (mainly chowmein snd chilli chicken) was fantastic both in terms of quantity and quality. Was a pure heaven for college goers like us. I decided to again give it a try after 13-14 years and packed the food on my way home. The quantity is still huge but the taste has degraded a lot. The hakka noodles was very salty and had extremely few chicken pieces - very disappointed. The dry chilli chicken was good though. Sometimes I feel if you have good memories of something in earlier years, dont try to revisit  it again as results might be unsatisfactory.",negative

Perched on the 9th floor of the same building that houses the Fatty Bao, you can see the entire Kolkata skyline with high rises on one side and the Victoria Memorial on the other.

Coming to the food, there are lots of options in starters, main course items, drinks and desserts. If you are here, then don’t miss sipping on the Manga cocktail which has a vodka base and green mango flavour. We directly ordered a chicken Katsu bowl and auntie Vinnie’s berry pulao. The berry pulao had shredded mutton and chicken balls with sweet berries on top. Loved it totally. The snicker bar in the dessert was the perfect thing to end the meal.

Totally love this place! Surely visiting again",positive

The food is also nice, with we ordering a pizza and a pasta that they recommended. The pasta was normal, nothing crazy. The pizza stole the show though, with the thinnest crust i have ever seen and the edges having a great smokey and burnt feeling. An authentic pizza i would say, not the Indian kind we get everywhere else.

They have the fastest service i ever saw, we didnt have to wait for even 5 mins before the food arrived.

In a nutshell, amazing place to come with your partner or your friends and have a nice pizza!

The have two tables laid out in the open if you want to sit and have your food. Otherwise they deliver amazingly fast.

The menu is pretty limited. They have stuck to primary Chinese and other than that some Indian styled fries.

Coming to the quantity and quality of food, all their items come in huge potions (difficult to finish for one person at a time) and tastewise they won't disappoint you. They might not offer you high class Chinese but the outcome on your plate will leave you satisfied.

FOOD- 2/5
SERVICE- 2/5
RECOMMENDED- No.
Had visited this place once after shopping in Esplanade. The ambience is just as that of a roadside fast-food joint. The place had no A.C. back then. Had visited only because it was famed to be an old restaurant with quality food. The behaviour of the staff was not cordial. We had ordered naan and panner tikka masala. Taste was way below average. Prices were surprisingly high inspite of the sheer lack of beautiful decor, hospitality and most importantly the quality of food. Given there are roadside places around this area that serve much better quality food at 10 times lesser prices, I shall give this place a pass.

2.Rice
3.Salad
4.Golda chingrir malai curry (4/5)
5.kosha Mangsho (4.5/5)
6.Pesta kulfi (5/5)

All the items we ordered was really good and Serves hot&fresh. The vetki fish fry was out of the mark, You must try it.
The other two side dishes is also best, Those are also suggested, prawn size was to much big & mutton was also tender..
The end of the part is come to dessert, We really loved it, mouth melting.
Overall we feel the flavours of Bangladesh.

We decided on mocktails and continental from the Pujo menu.
Food: Hawain salad, cheese cherry skewers,whole bbq chicken and a steak.
The salad was great, tasty and high protein. The skewers to prevent the cheese from melting came with ice cover. The bbq chicken came with french fries, veggies, the sauce and rice.The steak with bread butter.

9056,"Zomato is spoiling me with exciting new offers and discounts!! And I can't help but keep ordering through Zomato.
This time I ordered from this Momo joint called Momo's Point because of the variety of momos they are offering in a pocket friendly price.
I ordered one plate of chicken tandoori malai momo through Zomato. The delivery was quick and prompt. The food arrived in a cardboard box,5 pieces of chicken momos,slightly grilled,fully covered in a creamy sauce. The momos tasted nice, worth every penny. The sauce or 'malai' is very delicious.. slightly tangy and spicy. It contains cheese and mayonnaise.
If you love cheese or mayonnaise,and love momos, I'd strongly recommend the malai momos.",positive

I ordered the Thai chicken one, which was very assertively recommended by the attendant with a rather warm presence. The manager came up and informed that the food will be ready in about 8mins. To my surprise, it was there in 5. The salad was healthy, vibrant, fresh and I loved the minimal dressing. The staff was very courteous and the ambience lovely. Hygienic and fragrant too.

This place serves Biriyani of medium quality it's not that tasty but average. I didn't like it's taste much. The chicken was soft and fresh but the rice lacks the taste of an authentic Biriyani. The chaap was too oily and spicy. Quite heavy to digest. Though chaap is never light but I feel the quality of ingredients was not so good. Just given 1for the chicken.,negative

Found it to be very sufficient for a afternoon meal where you don't want a spicy meal, rather wish for some tasty homely food. Eating spicy food always can be switched with these thaalis. And the best part was their packaging. It was well packed and nothing got leaked.
The food was light. Not at all heavy on stomach. Papad was even crispy after delivery. Dal was thick. And aloor dum was best accompanied with rotis. Raita was also good. A bit thick so that it doesn't drip off.
Overall a good homely thali for 140.",positive

Although I have had better fish fingers but the other two items were satisfactory. We had a pocket pinch of 540 for two which I think is not too much. However it is worth a try.

They have sitting arrangements, although not organized (floor is partially covered with ration).
They serve different kind of food items, all being prepared by cooks behind the counter. So, all the items are served hot and fresh.I ordered a plate of fried chicken momo, and veg pasta with white sauce, as take away option. They prepared and delivered the food very fast. The quantity was more than enough for 2 persons, as evening snacks. Food was delicious. Reasonable pricing and good service by The Brunch Box.

The drink mango cooler was refreshing,the tulsi leaves in it added a nice flavour.

The Sambhar Vada was a let down. The Vada tasted slightly bitter and had a grainy texture.
The Filter Coffee was just the perfect South Indian brew. We ended up having a repeat.
All in all, a nice and laid-back place to indulge in a hearty banter with loved ones and friends.

Veg Fried Rice -

It had peas, carrots and spring onions. Rice grains were long and was properly cooked. But something was missing as the taste was like normal rice or pulao.

Paper Chicken -

Chicken pcs were big and contained 4 pcs. The gravy was very simple (zero spice and less flavors) which seamed like soup. Chicken was hard which made chewing difficult.

We ordered a lemongrass tea, a hot chocolate, a plate of beer battered fish, and a dark chocolate zucchini bread. The other two items were also pleasant, but the highlights of the day were the hot chocolate and the zucchini bread.

The staff members are attentive, and the place is cozy.

In all, I would surely recommend Artsy to anyone who is roaming around the Minto Park area in search of a place where he/she can spend some quality time without burning a hole in the pocket.",positive

We went for lunch and I was delighted to see all the Bengali dishes in the menu, at a loss for what to order. We ordered Bhetki Fish fry and Topshe fry for starters. Both are Bengali delicacies and were great as expected. Then we ordered our main course comprised of plain rice, muro ghonter dal, chingrir bati chochhori and mutton dakbunglow. The rice with mutton combo was just special, the chochhori was unexpectedly good, the dal was good as well. For dessert we ordered chal er payesh and Mishti doi and both of them were good. Recommended place for Bengali cuisine.",positive

Then again it should be mentioned that certain staff is new and hence they are not atall having any idea of what to suggest its customer or not.
Now coming to the food quality it’s just awesome, and at a place like this it is always better to go for buffet else you won’t be able to get the glimpse of the variety of food the place is having.
Conclusion can be drawn as a very expensive place with variety of food. So it’s good for 1 time visit.",positive

Haleem is the most delicious of them..
With no alternative on the swiggy delivery list, I opted for chicken haleem from this place last evening..
But it was purely a disaster!!
I received the order at least 2 hours after placing it.
Then coming to the food, it was not tasty at all. It seemed that they added some pre cooked chicken pieces in the mixture(u may call daal makhani instead, wat they sent) of daals. We just couldnt finish our meal!! :-(
Think twice, before u place an order.. :-D",negative

The prices are super pocket friendly here but the quality of the food they serve is just average. On top of that, the service too is extremely poor with the waiters not even coming to your table for 10-15minutes to take the order after you are made to seat. You can try their Chicken Biryani combo which consists of A portion of Chicken Biryani, 2 pcs Chicken Tikka Kebab and a Chicken Chap.",negative

The wide variety of combo menu's were a delight to us.
We had ordered
Lucknowi biryani
Hyderabai biryani
And
Chicken dakbunglow along with jangli Pulao :p

The lucknowi biryani consisted of egg and potato along with very soft well cooked chicken piece.
Though it could have been a bit less spicy.

The Hyderabadi biryani was on point.

The chicken dakbunglow was so scrumptious and so was the Pulao so soft!!

Overall pocket friendly. The chicken biryani was priced at 230 bucks and the combo at 270. This place deserves a visit.",positive

They gave us auspicious looks and commented very bad words ... When we were ordering one by one ... They were talking very weirdly and they acted very rude while we were there ... At the end we have them tips ... Still they said ... "" You people are here for more than 3 hours and tips just this much?"" It's not legal actually ...

For starters we had a dumpling platter and pork-and-sesame buns.
For mains we had udon noodles(duck) and pork ribs.
For dessert- raspberry delice and chocolate hazelnut mousse.
I loved the pork ribs- they are the best I have had till now and being a pork lover let me assure you I've tasted quite a few...nothing beats these.
And the raspberry delice also stood out for its unique flavor.
All the rest of the dishes were good, specially their dumpling platter stole my palate away!!🤣
Only have one tiny grievance- the pork buns were a bit dry on the inside and compared to the other dishes not that flavorful either.
Otherwise, a superb rating goes to their food- they are one of a kind.",positive

8826,"Had passed by this place many a times without really noticing it. Today checked it and believe me I have no regret. The cafe is situated in the basement. Lovely comfy sofas. TV and projector on the opposite walls to help those who wished but was unable to sit near TV. Ceiling decorated with used alcohol bottles an innovation. There is hookah too. The nice smelling room and the lovely staff are added advantages. Adequate lights and lovely recorded music.
We ordered dry chilli chicken and cappuccino for me. The chicken pieces are big and juicy. The cold coffee was excellent.
Surojit Roy the manager took good care of us. This outlet seems to be a part of a hotel and upcoming rooftop lounge and banquet. He took pains to take us for a recce all over the place. I tell you, after everything is completed, people will talk about this.
Parking available in the premises.

My order included Fish o Fry, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chilli Garlic Noodle, Chilli Fish and Kungpao Chicken. Everything was prepared properly, delivered fast and tasted good.

There are three sections, one is the dance floor with the DJ, second is the bar counter and third the lounge area with good and comfortable seating.

For foods, the must try are the masala french fries and the crispy fried chicken. The chicken was one of the best I have had and is served along with french fries, a cheesy dip and two types of sauces. Also, the Apollo fish is a good one to try. Good ambience and the staff were very courteous and helpful.",positive

The frames on wall can be purchased too. They books and games to spend real good time.
Let's come to food.
Food is a little expensive here then other places and not the worth the value. Only I item I liked here was Belgian waffle topped with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. We ordered fries which had a little extra salt to taste which was not good. They fresh lime didn't taste like fresh lime at all. I hope for the betterment of the food quality and quantity too, as the quantity is very little to fill.
Surely visiting again. You should visit too.

The patrani machhli (we opted for surmai) was moist and aromatic. The salli chicken was soft and yet it wasn't falling right off the bones.

425,"Some food experiences are so good that you don’t know what to write. Pa Pa Ya is truly a fine dining experience in every possible way. They are having  a Christmas Special Brunch Menu and we were lucky enough to be there on 24th and experience it. While most buffets and brunches make you move around the floor, picking food of your choice, here everything was served on the table. This made a huge difference. The personal attendance at the table is very special and makes your experience super comfortable and relaxing. The only thing that I had to do was click good pictures and eat. The food looks perfect and tastes amazing. They use the freshest ingredients and that reflects on every dish. Overall a very satisfying experience. Probably will be back this weekend to taste their ala carte",positive
6563,"Please read the rating as 2.5 🌟.

My review is based on my food delivery experience.

I have more than once order or tasted Biryani from Krazy Biryani.

The Biryani tastes quite good but the chicken pieces are always dry and fibrous, it is a sign of over cooking or under marinating.

I have not tasted any other dishes yet. I hope they will be better, if so I will change my review and rating accordingly.",negative

9889,I love ice-creams! It is not just a statement but it is an emotion! I am probably one of the few people who eats ice creams all year round. Baskin Robbins has always been a favorite! I love their ice cream rolls and the red velvet one is just delectable! I also love the honey crunch icecream that they make! Please visit if you havent already!,positive
4005,"This joint is just a minute walk from my den.
Outdoor seating and a quite few better to say a takeaway joint.
Nice staffs and really they were very courteous.
Food specialised for Biryani and kebab
Biryani rice were good but the chicken and mutton pieces were not very tender. It might be due to I am there First customer of the day and they had just prepared it.
Talking about there rolls it was really quite awesome. They might come up with some other varieties as well then it will be cherry on the cake..",negative
3646,"are you craving for something not out of the ordinary? something not too spicy or too bland ?? then you don't have to look far for koko chino is at to your rescue!

located near sulekha crossing this tiny eatery packs quite a punch! you can try their tsinghoi chicken with chicken Schezwan fried rice. tsinghoi chicken will suit your pallette just right... Schezwan rice is not too spicy. this is a hit combo! you can also go for mixed hakka noodles and Schezwan fish. hakka noodles to my opinion was a bit bland for my taste. schezwan fish tasted fine though!

my recommendation try to drop here at lunch time ...the space is too tight and remains crowded after late afternoon. do give it a try here. you won't regret it ! You can avail Take Away facility too!",positive

There is an inner space available like a small lounge, which I felt is way too loud and not so cozy for any individual. I liked the happy hours pricing and the drinks available under it. For small budget is outings this can be a good place.",negative

It was lunch time and the place was almost full house, luckily just as we entered a table on the window side got vacant :) it was a nice sunny winter and the ambiance was really soothing. I will have to mention that all the staffs are very polite, warm and helpful.
We ordered ultimate Mojito and some other drink (forgot the name), Classic Chicken Nachos, Herb grilled Fillet and grilled chicken breast.
Both the drinks were above average. The Classic Chicken Nachos was the show stopper of the day ❤ it was just awesome with right amount of cheese and lots of chicken on each piece of nachos. The Herb grilled Fillet was also very good. Only let down was the grilled chicken breast, the meat was too hard to even cut with the knife. Never mind. The bill was around ~2800 and we had a nice time there. Would love to visit again to try out other dishes.",positive

There are various offers on the drinks which change time to time. We ordered beer at 1099 for 6pints. For food we ordered shredded chicken in BBQ sauce and a pizza. Pizza was great, thin crust with generous toppings and mozzarella.

Besides the drinks they also have hookah at 500 for a flavour. They made a very good combination of pan with rajnigandha which made our day. Overall a complete package with good food, drinks and hookah even though the prices are little on the higher side.",positive

7835,"The only bengali cuisine delivery option nearby , so ordered one portion each of Jhinge Aloo posto , Alu dum , mutton dakbunglow and Lebu Lonka Murgi. The pricing is no less than those of the popular bengali restaurants at kolkata . Veg and fish options are limited atleast for delivery. However dissapointed seeing the quantity of meat , 3 nugget sized pieces each of chicken and mutton mostly comprised of bones. the chicken wasn't cleaned and boiled properly , and the blood red gravies had gallons of oil floating on top.Mutton was stale. The names of the dishes were no where close the original recipes and all the three were just chicken, mutton and potatoes in super spicy super oily gravies. Not worth the money definitely.",negative

About the Biryani, the taste is good however, its not very consistent. Sometimes its too good, sometimes its just okay. The quantity is a little less than sufficient however that could be ignored given the pricing is very reasonable. 
Good job Food Junction, keep up the good work and be consistent in terms of your food quality.

They play karaoke there, and some of the guys actually sing well. It is spacious and obviously has room for dance too.
Coming to the food, taste wise everything was pretty good. The standout was of course the Chocolate Shake. It was just amazing and will leave you wanting for more. The chocolate was melted and fixated on the glass, and added to the experience, though I can see some people being bothered by the work from scraping it off. But I liked it.

979,"This review is based on the home delivery I ordered. I have never been to this place. Anyway this was a simple order of one chiken tandoori. I will just point out the pros and cons

Pros:
1. Packaging was nice. Tandoori was cut into 4 pieces which made it easy to eat.
2. Taste was good enough. It was tender, moist and flavourful.
Cons:
Too much food colour used. It was unnaturally red that led to my fingers and mouth red. It was completely unnecessary.

If no colour used then this would have been one of the best tandoori in town.

Anyways looking forward to order again.

131,"Visited this place 2 days back. The place is located between Ballygung Phari and Quest Mall. The ambiance is quite good. They have separate hookah zone and normal dinning place. They also have private dinning area. The stuff here are very friendly and helpful. One of the things I personally didn't like is that you need to have their membership card for having drinks. Maybe the restaurant authority can omit this membership card system. If you don't have a card you need to pay Rs 50 to get one. Leaving out this part, the place is awesome. The taste of the food is good but can be better. On Thursday they offer free shots to ladies of the house. They also have normal happy hours from 1pm to 11pm everyday of the week.
The dishes we tried here were:-
💥 Pan Fried Chilly Fish: 4/5
💥 Crispy Chilly Baby corn: 4/5
💥 Chicken 65: 3.5/5

What we had :
🔸BLACK BURGER
🔸PERI PERI TWISTER
🔸CHEESE TWISTER

✔️The Black Burger is the show stealer! It's freshly added to their menu, the black buns are baked in their own ovens and the veg patty inside is very very crunchy, with enough amount of mayonnaise. A good effort with the Burger.
✔️Coming to the Twisters, they are served with lot of Peri Peri masala and a drizzle of mayonnaise. The masala at times seems too much though, otherwise tasted good. They have to balance the flavors.
✔️The Drinks were good, Mojito and Blue Lagoon.

Coming to the food, I would say pretty average. The initial dishes, the starters were good. But the main courses were somewhat not that good. I took oriental fried chicken but it lacked both salt and oriental spices. The baked rosogolla was good though. The gravy noodles and the chilly chicken was okay-ish.

I may visit there again but it's a big may.

5416,"If you really want some proper authentic Thai food in this city at an affordable price, the must go for this outlet. Located just near to the Lord’s Junction near South City at Prince Anwar Shah Road. A small joint having a seating capacity around 8-10 people is ready to serve you some authentic Thai food.

They are very much concerned about their quality as well as the authenticity. The food and the quality is really upto the mark.

Coming on to the food..

The most recommended items are Chicken wings with Thai bbq sauce, Phad Kung, Kaeng Khao Wan, Assorted Dimsum & Chicken Dimsum and Rangoon noodles.

9143,The best filter coffee in Kolkata. This is a stone's throw away from my place and thereby we frequently visit seetala Udupi for breakfast. I love the sambar here which is tangy but not too spicy and they serve one of the best uttapams here too. Do give the place a try if you are in this neighbourhood.,positive
54,"This is one of the ""must visit"" places in Park Street. The Chinese food is amazing here, will make you come back to this place again and again. Another plus side is the pricing, which is light on the pocket. The drinks menu is somewhat limited and I feel they can have more options, but that won't deter me from giving a 5 star. Happy dining!!",positive
6859,"A pocket friendly place to eat, service is good as well as the food quality. Maybe its not a fancy place with lot's of hard to pronounce dishes but a better place to eat in the area.",positive

10295,"On navami, we went for a family lunch at Penguin Inn. As we thought, in durga puja times we have to stand on the queue. But the scenario was totally opposite, we went there at 1:30 pm and only 3 seats got filled up. Then we ordered for fish orly which was very tasty, butter nun, murg mirch masala and mutton biriyani. The murg mirch masala was noting but chicken tikka butter masala which was nicely prepared, but the mutton biriyani was the worst part of the lunch. The biriyani rice was hard, that I have not expected and another negative point they were not serving any cold drinks too.",negative
4318,"Last Sunday afternoon I have visited this place for a quick snack.
Location: The restaurant is between TCS Gitonitan and RS software,more precisely between Enamiah and Nasta south Indian restaurant.
Ambience: it's a neat and clean little restaurant,not much decorative but actually was really nice.
Service:Waiters were very humble and they give you ample time to choose your dishes.
Food: we have ordered fried chicken and mixed fried rice. Quantity wise it should suffice two people.Mixed fried rice was really tasty and full of fresh prawns. The fried chicken was good,perfectly tossed with capsicum,onion and sauces.
Pocket pinch: those cost us 368/- including tax and a soft drink.
Conclusion: suitable for casually planned dining.come with large group,it will be much cheaper. I will again visit to taste variety of fried rices and I request the authority to keep rice noodles in the menu.",positive
7653,Comparing the price the food was moderate but their packing is terrible. I ordered food but their packed in aluminium foils instead of plastic containers hence all the chicken preparations spilled out and spoilt all my food. Even the delivery agent was disgusted. Hence I won't ever order here and I hope other readers won't order unless they want their days to be spoilt too,negative
4379,"Went to this relatively small joint with Debabrata Ghora to gorge on their crispy chicken strips and juicy murgh reshmi kebab. They were delicious. The coating of the strips was not over powering which added to its flavour. They give sumptuous portions at such a low price.
One issue is that they don't have a proper seating place and thus people have to hurdle while eating.
Otherwise it is a pretty decent place for fried chicken lovers.",negative
10762,"We ordered a non veg noodles combo and a non veg starters combo. Loved both the dishes.
Special mention would definitely go for the babycorn! God, it was amazing!",positive
1313,"On this auspicious occasion of 'Lights', a very dear friend gifted me a box full of sweets, that included 'Kaju Katli', 'Kaju Kamal Bhog', 'Kaju Barfi' and lots more...

Firstly, the box in itself looked 'pretty' with such amazing delicacies arranged in sequence..
Loved the flavor of each and every item --- No gift could have been better than this.........",positive
3359,"An outlet of the Dada Boudi Restaurant, this place assures good taste, great quality at a satisfactory quantity. It serves several varieties of rolls, momos, noodles and fried rice. Paneer roll and Manchurian fried rice is what I prefer here. The amount of fried rice they serves in 1 plate is well enough to fill up 2 hungry tummies. The staff members are well behaved but the only con of this outlet is its ambience. A bit crowded and no proper comfortable sitting arrangements to enjoy your meal. Its better to take away or order for a home delivery.",positive
5991,"After a movie we dropped in here . We ordered for chicken ham and olive pizza, penne pasta with vegetables and parmesan cheese , guava passion and fudge brownie. I had to alter my order as most of items I wanted were unavailable. I really liked the pasta in taste (but was served extremely cold), the guava passion served was nothing but preserved juice served. The service not to forget was too slow and delayed. I was too disappointed with the service (while serving or getting the bill to the table , even water was placed on the table after 20 minutes). Not a good enough place to pay a visit I guess.",negative
2697,"There is no doubt with the ambience! Staffs were very pleasing and helpful.But what disappointed me was the food quality.The tastes of all the dishes would have been much better compared to price offered.
We had tried crispy chilly baby corn,Singapore rice noodles,chilly garlic noodles,veg dumplings in chilly lemon sauce,summer breeze and flavoured lemonade blue.
Chinese cuisine was much satisfactory.",negative
11037,"This is a delivery only outlet. On my visit to a friend's place, I ordered the following:
1. Chicken Cheese Roll
2. Chicken Sandwich
3. Chicken Chowmein
4. Chilli Chicken
5. Chilly Babycorn

Out of the list of items ordered, the Chicken Cheese Roll is a must try. The roll was loaded with marinated pieces of chicken and cheese which tasted really good. The Chilly Babycorn was good. I think there is a room for improvement in Chilli Chicken and the other dishes were pretty good. It is okay for snacks or a casual/light dinner.",positive
3692,"Yesterday I came here to have dinner with my family and i must say we were extremely pleased with the food.
This place has good accommodation capacity and divided into two floors. We wanted to try their la carte menu so we had,

🔅 Pan fried chilli fish (RECOMMENDED) 5/5
🔅 Chicken fried rice 4/5
🔅 Tsing ho chicken 4/5
🔅 Honey glazed lemon fish (RECOMMENDED) 5/5

The service was fast but the servers are not that efficient at their work. The hospitality was amazing and i would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",positive
744,"I've finally found a place which serves butter naan just the way I like it. Soft, crispy, not too thin or thick, and with loads of butter. I'll definitely recommend the butter naan over here.

The paneer tikka lababdar was fantastic. I really liked how they didn't chop the paneer to tiny bits but instead gave big whole pieces of it.

The daal makhani tasted very good as well. I'll recommend both these dishes if you're visiting

The service here is good and the waiters are helpful and guide you with the menu.

Not too heavy on the pocket. I'll definitely recommend.",positive
11294,"Ordered via Foodpanda from this place!!

The hing kachori is lip-smacking and tasty, you can try the gulab jamun which will melt in your mouth, so soft and tasty. the jalebis are really good. 

To end your breakfast extravaganza you can end it with their special tea.

I had ordered Chicken Reshmi Tikka Kebab and Mutton Biriyani. The Biriyani was very good. Really light, less oil and tasted very good. The pieces of the kebab were also good.
The price was also moderate and affordable. I would like to visit the restaurant soon.

2303,"Situated near Chowrangi Square, it's a gem.
At the end of the month, if you want to fulfil your taste buds not bringing a hole in your pocket, boom, you are in the right place. We tried Chinese dishes, they were perfectly cooked and amount was sufficient to fill two stomachs. The price of the drinks is also very reasonable. Beside all these pros, the cons is that this place has no music, and that makes the place a lil boring. Otherwise thumbs up to this place.😊",positive
4988,A decent place for having North Indian food. The lighting was a pretty low and we had to use our phone's flash to read the menu. The food took quite a while to come and we had to wait for a while as well to get or table. It's a place that needs some work,negative

2861,"I opted for weekdays buffet for my birthday. The service is great as expected from lalit. The Serene white décor and calm ambience is very very soothing, definitely a treat for the soul. Coming to food it's kind of okayish, I'd still prefer other buffets in town. The veg section was really good, but then that's all. The dessert section was also okayish. I wanted to give a better rating but the food really disappointed me. Sorry. I can visit next time for ala carte may be.",negative
1497,"We had went there when this cafe had just opened so the prices are not the same now anymore.
This is a paradise for Game Of Thrones lover. It is themed on that series, has books related to it too and lastly the Iron Throne(GOT fans would know it's importance)
We had their wildling's Pizza, Chicken in Madras Masala, The night is dark and full of mushrooms, Fish Ballista and Joffrey the Jerk Chicken.
I loved the food though I felt the Chicken in Madras Masala had more french fries compared to the amount of chicken.
I am giving this a 3 star because the service was really slow and our waiter had totally forgotten about the last item we had ordered. We had to sit for about an hour to realise that they were not making our dish. The service was so slow that we thought that we'll get our dish.
You should definitely visit the place because the food is definitely great.",negative

5878,"I found the quality of food to be pretty standard, however their waiters need to smile. They appear to be grumpy and impolite. Customer service is zero here. Ambience is okay. Not much privacy around, as the gap between tables isn't much. Good place for a lunch on the go.",negative
2287,So visited this place yesterday.. it was a pretty decent place.. so we ordered Tom yum soup with a crispy chicken starter lat Mai Kai.. the chicken was spicy and delicious and we can tell that they served authentic Asian food.. for main course we ordered egg wrapped rice with schezwan chilli Chicken.

1717,"Been here for a sat dinner, vry crowded. Very few options with Jain menu so not much variations I could order.

In starters we ordered tomato dhaniya shorba which was like okay shorba being very watery like.
In food we had ordered pesto khandvi.

Khandvi is tried & tested gujju dish but the variation of pesto was little different, although I dint like it much as pesto flavour was very strong.

In main course we ordered fried rice which were surprisingly sweet .

Mix daal was good and chilly cheese naan had very little cheese in it.

Probably regular veg had more options but if you are looking for Jain options I wouldn't recommend you to be here.",negative

But it was totally a disappointment. The paratha was as far from Malabar paratha as far Kolkata is from south India. It tasted and was more like Batura. The kurma too was just like a coconut paste.",negative
1127,"This place is located near Rabindra sarobar metro station. The restaurant has a very unique ambience to it. The concept is very different. You can wet your feet in water and get the experience of having food by the sea.

Coming to the food-

Tom Kha soup- this soup was very different and tasty. The soup is based on coconut. Yet the flavour of the coconut wasn't very strong.

Squid salt and pepper- this was also very good. Highly recommendwd.

Lobster in oyester sauce- the presentation of this dish was very attractive. The show stopper of all the dishes. The lobster was also very fresh and the sauce and the lobster's taste blended very well.

Pad thai- this was a regular pad Thai noodles which tasted very good.

Overall this restaurant is highly recommended. For the ambience as well as the food. The staff of this restaurant is also very courteous which adds to the usp.",positive

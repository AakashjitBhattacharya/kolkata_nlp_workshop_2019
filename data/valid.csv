4141,"Quite a nice place with a few gadgety delivery of food items which arrive at your table on a conveyer belt. I would have given this place a sure 4+ but possibly my visit happened at a wrong time when they were closing down. It was during Durga Puja in kolkata and we were the last customer (entered around 11.15 pm). So, was in a rush to order in one go as the kitchen would close down. Also, they didnt have the bar running. But the food was tasty and the served quite elegantly. Will surely go back some other time and this time a bit earlier. Kolkata lacks Japanese outlets, so....",neutral
5571,"I had been there to attend a birthday party last week.It is on the top floor of Mani Square Mall.
Very frankly speaking, the only thing I have been impressed with was the décor of the place.The dim lights into the restaurant and the designer artefacts hanging from the ceiling created an enchanting prelude but soon the short lived halcyon disappeared.
Neither the starters nor the main course passed the test,one of the many reasons for that disliking was that the foods had gone cold unexpectedly.Well it was a buffet menu,so I was expecting most of the foods to be served hot.In the main course, the rice with corn kernels and veggies was tasteless and the mutton curry was nothing but horrible.So improperly cooked that it seemed that it would take a saw to cut the mutton chunks.The only hope was the dessert section having Gulab Jamun,brownies and Vanilla Ice Cream making up for the rest of the disaster.The red velvet cake was fine.
The experience did not match the expectations.",neutral

The place is quite good with variety of items on their menu .We had the Chicken Alfredo Pasta ,Mexican Chicken Skewers and Chocolate Fondue. The Chicken Skewers were not that great in taste but the Pasta was quite good. The restuarant took our hearts with it's Chocolate Fondue which was too good to taste.",positive
3209,Though it was bit soggy beacuse they use many kinds of flavours. It will be soggy guys. Stop complaining about this. But the taste was just lit af. I loved it as usual. J in the Jungle.

Dosa with Sambar and Coconut Chutney
Rate : 4.5/5

South Indian platter can't be boring, they have twists to offer in the taste.
So try the Dosa from Gupta Brothers, Hindusthan Park, Gariahat and relish it.
All the vegetables in the sambar will melt in your mouth.
The curry leaves taste so soothing and burst of flavours in your mouth will keep adding with a bite of dosa and a sip of sambar along with coconut chutney.",positive
7956,Thankfully the day ended extremely well when our host at Fusion helped us with the blissful order. Going through Hatibagan everyday I had spotted this very restaurant and wondered how will it be like when on 31 August 2018 after watching the movie Stree I dropped in here. The masala naan was pure love alongwith the chicken lababdar garnished with egg. The butter naan was the typical type but the only one which didn't live upto my expectations was the lachcha paratha. Hopefully I'll get a better one the next time I drop in here.,positive
10609,"Location- Tollygunge circular road (Near Hindustan Sweets signal)
It's just a simple fast food centre with only takeaway facility available.
They make different kinds of rolls, snacks, biryani and few chinese items. I have tasted the biryani which is too oily and also not tastes good. Even roadside biryani shops made better biryani than them. The rolls size is quite big comparatively than other fastfood centre and it's tastes not that much bad. Tried fish finger and fish fry but very hardly found any portion of fish. They make the noodles awesome for that only i am putting 2 stars. The shop is so small that you can't even stand after ordering the food.

Pocket friendly but they charge like other big fastfood centres only. Hygiene is also not maintained.",negative
200,"i have never been tired of going Tandoor House as it provides quality mughlai cuisine in the most budget-friendly way in the town.i have tried almost every item of their menu.and truely though these are not the best in the city but obviously good in comparison of cheaper prices.
The ambience is pretty organised with some antiques and dimly lit sitting arrangement.
which i love the most here are as following-

1)-Chicken /Mutton biriyani combo-
it costs only 155rs.but belive me it is very sufficient to fill one hungry tummy.this combo consists of one mutton biriyani(one piece aloo and dim also),two piece of chicken tikka/reshmi kabab along with chicken butter masala.

2)Badshahi pulao combo-
my another favourite.

3)Mutton kasha and tandoori nan

Coming to the Food:-
#Drums of Heaven(Olyester/Chilli Sauce) Rs. 250
10 Medium Sice Pieces whuch were perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.
#Cantonese Mixed Chowmein Rs. 250

827,"Rated 4* because of the interior design, ambiance, bar counter, sitting decor. But if i talk about the food quality, quantity and taste they should work on it. Because i have had same dishes much more tastier in other places that too in a low budget. So i shouldn't say that there menu has got something different and excellent. Cocktails also like it was good but nothing exceptionally amazing. If you guys can upgrade the food menu, quality, quantity and taste then it will just go hand in hand with the rest of the qualities that i have mentioned above. I just loved the interior of this restaurant, dim light, good musiz, perfect for boozing.",positive

6310,"The thing with many restaurants, particularly the multicusine ones, is that they make some food really well, but mess up with few others. An usual case is that of those which serve both Chinese and North Indian/Tandoor items. So it is often wise to read reviews and then place the order.
I ordered tandoori roti and Rajasthani gatta from here.The roti was warm and soft, and came wrapped in aluminium foil.The gravy item was good enough.They provided salad and Achar with the order.

Coming to food we went for their Chinese platter which had chilli fish, chicken wings, fried wanton and dry chilli chicken. All of them tasted equally amazing. We ordered peri peri baby corn too. It came with lip smacking mayonnaise. Batter was light and airy and the corn was cooked really well. We went for a Long Island ice tea also which shook me to be honest.

The ambience was good with games to add fun to conversations and unwind on a Friday . We went there for lunch.

Haze special shake and Brownie Cold Coffee was delicious.

Cheese fondue Pizza was pizza stuffed puffs with cheese fondue dip. It was delicious with unique presentation.

Aglio olio Momos were a twist to the usual momos and absolutely amazing. Their best seller.

Mascarpone Rucolo Pasta was creamy cheese sauce and with a side of Garlic bread which was ordered as a spaghetti was tasty too.

There was no out of the box dessert worth ordering so we avoided it.

This restaurant is located just beside Mio Amore. The ambiance of this cafe was nice, Small and cozy and they have ac too , so don't worry you don't feel uncomfortable at all.
Coming to food we ordered 2 masala dosa and 2dahi vada. We thought that masala dosa was over priced cause one masala dosa cost 100/- but after got our masala dosa, we realized that it was really big and one dosa can fulfill two tummies. Taste was really nice and worth it for sure.
I'm not that fan of dahi vada but still it was quite good.

Overall a very nice experience..",positive

I really loved the Wrap,Pizza, and Burger as it was perfectly made. Kitkat shake was also good.

Cheese Burst Footlong & Garlic bread tasted more or less the same. Now coming to Garlic Bread it lacked a bit of Garlic flavour and it could be improved.
Pasta was average and it needed to be a bit more cheesier.

However, the meat was greatly over-salted, no doubt to prolong shelf life, but surely some method can be found to diminish the salt, at the time of preparing. I would suggest reduction of quantity and more attention to inventory management. Still I have to admit, I enjoyed the fat saturated meal despite the many qualms I had.",neutral

One of the best kobiraji u can find under this roof. They serve special kobiraji with a thick tasty gravy with a sunny side up egg. Try their moghlai. Big zambo size moglai will definitely make you full.
Go n try gurudev if you are near nagerbazar.",neutral

The place is very small, but the ambience is nice and comfortable on its own way. We (count three) opted for their best seller dragon chicken along with veg spicy schezwan rice, mixed fried rice and chicken shyapta.

The rice items were great, with good quantity easily can be shared. Both the rice items went really well with the side dishes. Dragon chicken was a bit spicy but really loved the mouthwatering dish. But the dish which stole the show was Chicken shyapta, the well tossed sauces made it perfect.
The price is very much affordable, gst is included in the menu which is another plus point for foodies like me. Service was quick.

My tastebuds really liked the foods which they had.

Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo: This was a little different from the traditional tandoori Aloo. It had a stuffing of spices and dry fruits. So the hot of the tandoori spices was toned down with the mint yoghurt dip and the sweetness from dry fruits.

6061,"Ordered through foodpanda. First ordered mutton steak. And then subsequently ordered peri peri grilled chicken. For some strange reason mutton steak got confirmed then got cancelled. However, peri peri chicken was confirmed. It was foodpanda. So I knew it was useless to complain and left the delivery time to luck. Food got delivered after 90 minutes. Now coming to the packaging, it was extremely poor. Can you imagine the gravy was packed along with the chicken, rice and chips together in a paper box. Everything got messed up when I opened the box and the gravy was leaking. Now the taste, i love spicy food (and that's why I ordered peri peri chicken) but no matter how much ever you adore spicy food, it is still difficult for your taste buds to tolerate a dish made with 100gms of pepper. Very poor experience. Perhaps not going to order again. Much better continental places around.",negative

I ordered :-

⚫ Egg Chicken Noodles :- The  noodles lacked flavour. The chicken chunks were dry and tasteless.

⚫Half chilli chicken :- The chicken pieces were palatable. However the gravy was not well-prepared.

The food quality isn't good yet and in that price. They just taste little better then and footpath shops. The egg Chowmine is marked at Rs.70 for a full plate, is not at all Worthy and same for the other dishes.
There are much better places nearby offering good food at cheaper rate. Not much recommend.

What I tasted from their outlet?

The fine special noodles and also their egg chicken gravy noodles.

The first & foremost thing that I'll like to introduce to the readers is about the quantity.
No compromise on it, they offer a lot compared to the pricing.

Taste?
The fine special noodles comprises all the rich features of mushroom, chicken, egg & prawn - perfectly tossed & aggressively priced.
Tastes good enough, so does the gravy chowmein.

Classic & rich flavours.

Way to go The Fine, would be hoping that people give some generous thoughts to this place coz this place deserves atleast a 4+ star rating.

3263,"It is an awadhi restaurant located in ITC. The ambience is very serene and beautiful. The dishes are named elaborately but they have pictures printed, so that it becomes easier to order. Loved the dudhiya kabab and Mukund kabab. Loved the accompaniments. The paneer sabzi and Kali dal are prepared differently and are absolutely delicious. The highlight is the breads. All different types but so well made that you just want to keep eating. The only reason for the 4 rating is the biryani...it just wasn't good...and since its an Awadhi restaurant, it should have been excellent, but unfortunately it was a let down. So a must visit place, but biryani should be avoided.",positive
2544,"Ordered chicken biriyani from this outlet through zomato. Delivery was prompt on time.

Coming to the taste, it was not too tasty rather it was bland in taste. A big chicken piece and a small piece of alu was served with biriyani rice. Chicken was well cooked but big disappointed with alu as the size was too small. Rice was not too spicy or doesn't have any strong smell of gulab water which was good but overall it tasted bland. As i had tasted many more really tasty biriyani from roadside joints, this pappu biriyani was not up to the mark to my taste.Not recommend at all.

Overall pocket friendly. Chicken biriyani was only Rs. 85/- per plate.",neutral

Just a quick brief review about the food i ordered yesterday from Delish dhaba. i had to treat my friend and so i ordered crispy chilli baby corn and kadhai paneer . Baby corn was semi dry , crisp and it tasted really good. Kadai paneer was a bit oily but it satisfied my taste buds. 
In a reasonable price and on-time service the food just made our day.",neutral

Food:
Paper Masala Dosa and Club kachori are very good. I tried manchow soup which was good. In starters I tried Round Bread Corn Fitters and Dragon Paneer and both the items were pretty good. In main course it was north indian with paneer makhan kali dal shahi kofta and breads and to the delight food was great. A great mixture of spices and taste.

Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce (highly recommended)
 ginger capsicum chicken noodles
 Chicken hong kong
Chicken in oyester sauce,
Pan fried chilli fish.

8767,"Wanted a very light meal for lunch and hence ordered a pulao combo for office delivery from Swiggy Pop for a meagre 59 bucks – food, packing and delivery – all inclusive!

Delivery was pretty smooth – bang on time, also the packing deserves an applaud – a nice pretty air tight container – very little quantum of veg pulao topped with some moong dal and lauki preparation!

Yes, the quantity served is pretty low, but one can’t complain when he is paying just 59 bucks for a meal!

Coming to the food, since their funda is unadulterated healthy food, hence, they serve very nutritious stuff without compromising the taste much, which is quite remarkable in itself!

Pulao was well prepared with an amalgamation of decently chopped varied veggies and went well with the daal and lauki sabji!

Nice to see that food was warm when received – overall a pretty good experience for a very low price!

Will order some healthy food from them again pretty soon!",positive

One of the oldest institutions that probably need a marketing overhaul and a little bit of adjusting to the modern palates of Bengalis. Overall, food was good.",positive

But they disappointed in no section!
The food, the service, the drinks and the cocktails, all perfect!

What changes from outlet to outlet is the quality of food and the way the bar-tender’s ability to make the perfect cocktails! But this outlet definitely matched the taste and the quality with some other Biker’s cafe of Gurgaon and Delhi.

Just a drawback? The space crunch!

One of the best pure veg restaurants you can get in these parts .

Couldn't try the soup and jumped directly to the main course. Paneer butter masala , Mix vegetables curry , butter naan , garlic naan and chappati were laid fresh on the table.
The PBM was out of this world...very rich and creamy. It was going very well with the garlic naan...each one complimenting themselves for the flavour. The mix veg was a mixed bag..!😎

Nobody cares about the customer experience at all. I was waiting for a friend so thought to order a drink using Zomato gold but they denied saying, it needs two people so you got to wait for your friend. So I decided to order a drink (Jim Beam), glass was full if stains and had an alien particle in it. I asked them to change the glass and what they just transferred that drink to another glass which was also stained. I pointed that out to the manager/server/bartender but no one GAF.

However, if you order without looking on the right side of the menu, you will surely get a heart attack upon getting the cheque served to you. The pizza was tasting good until i realized that its worth more than 500 and the only topping it had was of cheese, tomato sauce and some tiny pieces of chicken here and there along with droplets of feta. Similar experience was with my plain white sauce pasta (costing about 350), which not even had basic veggies and was topped only with chicken, where the chicken add-on costed about 75, making the total cost to about 425 (just plain white sauce pasta and little pieces of chicken with no veggies).

Along with that we ordered Chicken Afghani and Beijing chicken..Both were tasty.

The veggies were uncooked and the rice was also a massacre.When we ordered,they showed some other pictures of the rice combo and gave in turn just a ""disgusting"" dish. Just wasted my bucks...This restaurant is such a disgrace.
How can anyone serve food like this?
Are they even human?
Right one am even sorta questioning their chicken...was it even ""chick""?",negative

They do not have much options in veg so we ended up ordering crispy chilli Babycorn, Kadhai paneer, Dal Makhani, Masala Kulcha and Butter naan. The food was not more than what we call pure average. The thing I disliked the most was the behaviour of the staff. No instances of misconduct or anything as such but they were not welcoming enough. They did not follow our instructions.

But one thing, they didn't have any quality management, meaning, one day it happened that I had burger there with a few of my friends, and later that day, I took a burger as takeaway. The takeaway burger was horrible. Now the shop has become very small, doesn't have air conditioning any more, has very less seating space and is no more suitable for hanging out with friends.

We had Watermelon and Basil Mojitos, Classic Caesar Salad, Lamb Chops, Grilled Bhetki with Garlic Butter Sauce, Cheese and Keema Stuffed Chicken Steak and last but not the least Cheese Fondue.

cold coffee- amazing

Now coming to food,I tried out there Chinese delicacies and it didn't fail to impress me.I tried China Town Manchow Soup,Dragon Spring Roll,Chinese Fried Rice,Chilli Garlic Noodle,Mixed Veg in Mild Garlic Sauce,Tsing Hoi Potatoes. I would recommend Dragon Spring Roll on the first place as I really loved the dip which was quite different in taste prepared with honey. The Noodles and Mixed Veg tasted quite good equally. If someone is looking for good vegetarian food they can surely choose this one. They serve good food both in quality and quanity at affordable rates. They have a good variety in their menu as well.",positive
8229,"**  POOR FOOD ALERT **   heard a lot about this place. I don't know what's wrong with them. First of all biriyani was not like biriyani it was something else...any road side stall makes better biriyani which costs around Rs. 80...Then they served us rotten biriyani ( Rs. 200) literally which was smelling bad. The stuffs were arguing with us in a cold manner that they make it today noon around 12.30 pm and we were there around 2 pm. It was a horrible experience, which was my first time in this place and for last time also. We had to paid almost Rs. 850 for this kind pathetic food. Don't visit this place ever.

Staffs are not so prompt,lazy and you have to wait for a long time to get your food even they were not aware of what’s available. Ordered murgh tikka and it was good.. then in main dish ordered chicken biriyani, it was pretty average.. then ordered chicken ala kiev also it was average one.. then ordered veg pulao (though it was not yellow) tasted good and then prawn malaikari was also above the average.. so it’s  nothing but a average restaurant with a good decor..",neutral

Talking about the ambience : it is a kind of place that takes you by aww, peaceful and archaic. And this place follows Peshawari traditions : we were asked to eat using our hands. Loved the concept . 
We had ordered : panner tikka , fish tikka and chicken tikka as starters : all of them well made , filling and tasty . 
Portions were also good enough .

For main course : Indian breads with the very famous dal bhukari. This dal was the best dal I ever ate . ( not exaggerating)

They have maintained the heritage look of this place, old stone oven, dough mixing bowls used as planter pots, old seating places etc. The property itself is located on a very old treelined street that gives a great feel. Inside lots of seating; some near the central kitchen, some streetside, some beside the bar, take your pick. Service is relaxed but courteous. If you are wondering if anyone is working on your order, dont, they are, just at a slower pace while managing hotel and phone orders. Maybe ask for a coffee while you wait. We ordered fish and chips, croque madam sandwich, croque messiure sandwich and few coffees. The fish was amazing, so were the sandwiches, huge portions too. Very nice experience, wish to visit again and again",positive

I got myself a nearbuy offer, had everything chicken - hot and sour soup, drums of heaven, chicken in hot garlic sauce, fried rice and hakka noodles. As it was a combo meal, I believe the quantity had been cut down to fit it's pricing. I have to say, their service is great, I would recommend this place purely based on how accommodating their service is. On the taste part, well it falls short on my expectations. Other than that it's a better place in the neighborhood.

We Ordered -
Cappuccino And Chicken Pasta In White Sauce.

The Cappuccino was served with two biscuits also, and that gained our attention because hardly any cafe provides biscuits anymore with tea/coffee.

The service is quite quick, the staff is polite, however some are still learning so they might need a repetition while you're ordering which isn't a big drawback.

The food quality is good. It tastes quite decent, it's not the best but it's not too bad either and a single dish or portion is enough for a person and sometimes even two people can share it and it's enough for two.

Mutton pieces were pretty small, and 1 piece was total fat! Not that good in taste too.
Quantity of rice was good for one, But the dal and sabji given was flavourless! Absolutely worthless.
Moreover what shocking was they mixed the Alu bhaja and papad in one pouch, and quantity of each was meager!
Chutney was watery and too sweet. Absolutely not value for money! This shit costs ₹225. Dont even try to order from here , one will get better options in this price. They did not even send a spoon or napkin with it, even though we asked for it.

Ordered chicken Meefoon,chicken fried rice, Mongolian chicken and sliced chicken in schezwan peeper.

2.chicken fried rice- quantity was not enough for 2.
Taste- Meefoon was better than rice.

3.Mongolian chicken- quantity good (10boneless chicken pieces). But sorry I know the taste of Mongolian style chicken but what they made that was just chicken in soya sauce.

4.sliced chicken in schezwan peeper- quantity and quality wise good.

Best part is they serve us mineral water for free.

Perhaps the most versatile menu there is, it ranges through Fish Amritsari, Corn Palak, Chhanar Daalna, Misti Polao, Patuir, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Biryani and a few more dishes.

Personally, this menu gives the feels of the Pujo Vibe. But then again, it should as it is designed specifically for them. Those who like to slow down when the world is moving at an insane pace.

Baked cheese bhetki patisapta- 5/5 again loved it.
Chicken polanno- 5/5 this is not biriyani. But tastes far better than normal biriyani. With a beautiful aroma nd unique taste it's a must have dish. Cintains one leg piece nd several small chicken cubes.

※Butter naan was soft and big and very delicious it went very well with the side dish

※Murg reshmi massala was the side dish of chicken dipped in spicy and rich gravy and went well with butter naan.

※Special mutton biriyani was another favourite of mine as it was cooked in fresh ghee and i loved the smell of ghee coming from the biriyani. The mutton was so nicely cooked that it was mouth melting and very delicious.

Now coming to the food and packaging.
Packaging is top notch with no spillage of food and served piping hot.
Quantity and quality are both equally good.

The Indian meal combo was more than enough for one person. The rice had the subtle flavour of jeera and the gravy was well blended. 
The saucy fries were pretty good with the essence of the Pav bhaaji Masala. 
My personal favourite was the nachos. Perfect amount of cheese and green nachos! I’ve never had that anywhere before! So pretty cool!!

Very much cost effective. 
Highly recommended.",positive

(Would have been better during the evening)We ordered rumali roti , tandoori roti and chicken butter masala. The chicken pieces were succulent and what I find worth a mention was butter was literally dripping from butter tandoori roti. Also, the gravy tasted just the way it should be. ( Nicely cooked and made to taste . ) The staffs are very cordial too. The total bill was 340 for two. Very easy to find, this is a restaurant to satisfy your hunger pangs easily.

The biriyani tasted average, but it was light, rice was perfectly cooked. The chicken dish was awesome, really rich gravy.

There was only one chicken and one fish preparation in non-veg starter and a baby corn and paneer preparation in the veg starter. Other than that, there were many types of salads, veg and non veg both. The chicken clear soup was not that tasty. The main course was good. There was rice, noodles and fried rice, all three.

884,"Visited this restaurant after reading the rave reviews of the place. The restaurant is on the first floor of a narrow, tower-like apartment complex. Strangely, it has no proper entrance and signboard. The stairway leading to the place is narrow and dingy.

Once inside, the surroundings are cramped. All these are compensated by the food though. Ordered the 555 Thali. The welcome drink, Lebu Lonka was appreciable. The starters and the main course were served simultaneously, which is a bit surprising. All the items were superbly and freshly cooked. Although several items could be repeated as part of the deal, the first serving was so substantial that one doesn't really needs to repeat anything. Of special mention is the prawn malai curry, the mutton curry, the fish cutlet and the chicken paturi.

Kudos to the management for their superb fare at very reasonable rates. Coupled with cooperative and gentle staff. I wish Saptapadi every success in the coming days.",positive

The ambience is also pretty basic, nothing to get you pampered. Having said that, they offer both north Indian and Chinese cuisines, as well as basic fast foods like rolls and all. I have been to this joint once and after tasting their food I was completely surprised. Considering their shabby and dull set up, I was really not expecting their dishes to be so exquisite and perfect. The quantities served was also abundant.

Also amongst the starters were a variety of Kababs and some lovely sushi. The main course was a delight and consisted of some exhilarating stuff, right from Biryani to Laal Maas to fish delicacies and so on. The desserts section was a dream come true..... especially for those with a sweet tooth. In the end Cafe Swiss does indeed spoil one with a plethora of dishes.

The total bill 1691 so you can imagine we had quite a lot . Attaching the bill in the photo section since taking pictures of so many things had not been possible. Some of the members of family said it was due to the excess oil that was in the mixed fried rice .we did not tell the restaurant at that point of time because all was super hungry at that point of time and you all know when you are hungry anything that is before you tastes heaven.

9003,"I would have rated it a 4 but for the fact that the Rava onion dosa that they served me was served with small chopped raw onions. Imagine..this place with its high reputation, doing do. Probably they got the order wrong and realized that instead of plain rava dosa the order was for onion rava and the chef just sprinkled the onions and it was brought to the table and served to me. The onions should have been sauteed on one side of the dosa which would have made them slightly translucent and sweet and enhanced the taste. The service too was slow. The masala vada was also not to my liking. I've had much better ones in the various south Indian food joints in the city.The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing.
Lovely decor with pics from Malgudi junction on the wall. They have utilised the small space well. But my food experience was thoroughly disappointing.",negative

I also ordered Chhichhora Pakoda tokri. Chatnis served with Pakoda arre worth of special mention. I would say that Pakoda was just above average by taste. Darbhanga Dahi kabab was delicious. Among dessert items, only 1 was available- Oye makhana. This item was just okayish. If you like kadak chai, then masala tea here is a must try. Must try item here is definitely Litti chokha with ghee. The restaurant is simply but nicely decorated. Staff are polite.",positive

Coming to the food-

Tom Kha soup- this soup was very different and tasty. The soup is based on coconut. Yet the flavour of the coconut wasn't very strong.

Squid salt and pepper- this was also very good. Highly recommendwd.

Lobster in oyester sauce- the presentation of this dish was very attractive. The show stopper of all the dishes. The lobster was also very fresh and the sauce and the lobster's taste blended very well.

Pad thai- this was a regular pad Thai noodles which tasted very good.

When i opened the Biryani Container the look was not at all pleasing. i know how much hardwork it takes to make a Biryani but your entire work goes in vain when you cant provide which the customer is looking for or even near to that. Biryani tasted Little Bland and was little sticky as well. Chicken Butter Masala was a shear Disappoinment.. Who gives Chicken Butter Masala with Bones?????? 
One plate of Chicken Butter Masala with only 4 pieces and all are with bones.. Are you Kidding me? 
Very Very Oily indeed even mixing it with the biryani cant even save both the dishe's taste.
Really a very bad experience. Disappointed.

I was so happy when I went there for the first time.. food is bellow average here nowadays! Last time when I visited the food was not good.. a chinese preparation we ordered was very oily.. I didn't like it.. prices are reasonable..",neutral

6955,"This is one from the very few counter serving Chinese at Avani Food Court. As the name says they also serve pasta but I tried only chinese this time. Here's what I've tried...

Chicken Hakka Noodles were of thick quality, well mixed with veggies & spices. Bit hot due to use of chopped green chillies. Overall okey to taste.

Chicken Manchurian gravy was thick & saucy. It was full with garlic & spring onion that actually enhanced its flavour. Chicken pieces were bit small but overall it tasted nice.

There isn't much cheap options available for filling chinese food in Avani food court. While this is the only option, their food is quite okey to try & it tastes good too.",neutral
1232,"Madira is at the Eden court, near to my office. Went there with my friends after office hour. The place is nicely decorated. We were greeted by the staffs. They suggested us some cocktail which are really good. But food items are very limited in number. You have to choose among only 4 5 choices. Not all of them are good. I liked their suggested starter but not the dish with chicken liver. Prices of dishes are okay. It can be a nice place to hand out for them , who are working near to new town or eco space.",positive
6874,"Keeping the review crisp and short, since there is nothing much to write about it. 

   Basically it is a roadside food outlet as you have seen them throughout Kolkata. On a night, we decided to have a try from this joint through the Zomato Online Delivery. Since we had not much expectations, we had ordered to simple and well known dishes, namely the Egg Chicken Noodles and Chilli Chicken. 

   It took around 30 mins for the order to be prepared and around 15 mins for the delivery by the Zomato guy. Since most of you have tasted the roadside noodles and chilli chicken once in your life, you will find the taste exactly same. The egg and chicken quantity in the noodles was good, and the chicken pieces in the chilli chicken was normal. Although the noodles tasted fine, the chilli chicken tasted was somewhat on the down side. 

   So overall, you can try the food here with normal expectations having roadside restaurant taste.

6783,"This might not be the best place for trying Bengali cuisine but not the worst either. Prices on the menu are pretty reasonable, consequently compromising on the taste and quality of the dish. The Hilsa/Ilish Bhapa was ironically fishy as far as quality is concerned. This is not the best place to go for Biryani either but it can be judged as moderate. Chicken tikka was spicy and good, just hoping not to find their name listed with the food quality control department someday. As far as packaging for delivery is concerned, it was very bad. Restaurants serving very oily and rich curry-based dishes should be well prepared with arrangements required for good grade packaging. Oil and curry was leaking out and it was very messy and dirty with curry stains.",neutral

The latter did had a good amount of veg poppers topped with a lots of mayo but the fries itself tasted a bit bland. Quantity of the fries are decent and the price is kept very reasonable.

Mutton biriyani was above the average but the mutton’s were mouth melting. Then ordered chicken butter masala as usual it was pretty good there.

Took their salad at the end. Tomatoes, Onions and Cucumber on a plate for 10 bucks.

Coming to delivery , we ordered :-

1. Tandoori Litti and Achaari Litti with Desi Ghee :- Two (2) pieces of each with aloo chokha, tomato bharta and green chutney.

First of all litti was very hard and too much dry;

Secondly, the quantity of Litti dissapointed me as they are offering only two (2) pieces of Litti at much higher prices compared to other 'Litti Shops' opened in the city.

Chokha was good and so was bharta ;

2. Cheese Pav Bhaji :- It was ok, nothing extraordinary ;

3. Sattu Paratha :- With mint chutney and pickles, sattu paratha was good but instead of mint chutney it should have been complemented with curd or raita which would have been much better choice.

1. We also ordered a Hookah which had smoke missing. On complaining the server changed it, still it was as useless as previous one. Being a hookah addict it was a total turn off .

652,"Molecular gastronomy as they call it. The best thing are the staff at this place. I should actually appreciate their attitude to celebrate the spirit of this place more than anything else. The food came with a lot of surprises. Mind you, I am not a vegetarian but I totally enjoyed their vegetable kolapuri and consider that as the best dish of the afternoon. The paneer was soft and the ice cream kulfi was super unique. The kulchas were soft and aptly stuffed. The tomato soup sets up the mood and explores your taste buds.

The only dissapointment of the afternoon was the spinach soup which turned out to be too creamy and very spicy. The paw bhaji was average. Yet, the staff pushes the bar at this place and hence they get a 4/5 in food and a 5/5 for the staff.

I am glad I made this visit. Recommended for people looking for a pure vegetarian place with a twist.",positive

I ordered

1. Chicken kabiraji
2. Chicken tikka roll
3. Fish batter fry
4. Chicken Mughlai paratha.

1. The chicken kabiraji was decent. It tasted good and had a fairly decent chicken breast in it.

2. The chicken tikka roll was awful, to begin with the paratha was soggy, and the sauce or ketchup what ever you called it, was the local coloured stuff that you see in road side food stalls.

3. Fish batter fry, I love fish batter fry so order 2 pieces of it. I was very disappointed to see two aloor chop like fish batter fry delivered to me, and one of them was not properly cooked.

4. The chicken Mughali Partha was drenched in oil, I squeezed out quite a few drops of oil from it, the stuffing lacked of taste and chicken . All I could taste was doughy thing that was used as a binder .",negative

Quality- The quality of the food was really good, as we thought that it might not be as hygienic as it is located in that sort of a small lane but it proved us wrong. 

Price- From the price point of view it is Reasonable,

Experience- It might seem that the shop is not located in a very good place but try giving it a visit and I am pretty sure that it will prove you wrong. And definitely try the chicken stew as it is really popular and delicious.

You should definitely give it a visit!!",positive

I ordered pork yaam wonton,mixed fried rice and pork chilli.
The pork yaam wonton was very simple to look at but it was bursting with flavours once tasted.
Mixed fried rice and pork chilli tasted too good especially the mixed fried rice.

Would have loved to give a higher rating, if not for the inconvenience caused by the restaurant. They just cancelled my order (for apparently no reason) even after the Zomato valet confirmed about the same and asked me about my location. When it was quite a time, I checked my order and found it to be cancelled. Then I repeated my order (but unfortunately this time the promo code didn't get applied and I had to pay Rs 150 more). But atleast the Zomato chat support helped and credited 100 credits in my account for the hassle caused. I am not disappointed with Zomato but highly disappointed with Zaikebaaz for the trouble caused. Had they not cancelled the order, I would have had 150 rs off.

This place is pathetic and also they overcharge for everything on their menu.Some items were even more expensive than, some reputed cafe in town.
My friend and I had settled for a cup of chocolate-coffee each after scanning the whole menu.The coffee seemed great to the eyes ,but did not taste good at all. Don't even get close to the space if you have hygiene concerns.
Or rather stay away at any cost and save yourself from a truck load of regret and wasting some money.
